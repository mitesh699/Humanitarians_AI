Summary of Work Completed in Past Two Weeks:<br/>
1.  Completed the remaining 50% of the foundational "Model Context Protocols" work, which was integral to the AI-Powered Conversational Travel Assistant.<br/>
2.  Finalized the full development and implementation of the **AI-Powered Conversational Travel Assistant**. This included:<br/>
    *   Enhancing Natural Language Understanding using Groq's LLMs (e.g., Llama 3) via LangChain.<br/>
    *   Implementing and refining multi-tool integration via MCP for: Flight Search (Amadeus API, Brave Search fallback), Accommodation Search (Airbnb via @openbnb/mcp-server-airbnb), Weather Information (Custom WeatherAPI.com MCP server), Local Discovery (Google Places API), Driving Directions (Google Directions API), and General Web Search (Brave Search API).<br/>
    *   Developing intelligent entity extraction, configurable search options in the Streamlit sidebar, contextual memory for conversation flow, and a reliable link display mechanism.<br/>
3.  **Recorded a comprehensive walkthrough video** demonstrating the AI assistant's capabilities and user interface.<br/>
4.  **Created the detailed project report and documentation** outlining the project's architecture, features, development process, and outcomes.<br/>

Challenges Encountered and How They Were Addressed:<br/>
1.  **API Integration Complexities:** Successfully integrated diverse third-party APIs by developing dedicated MCP server scripts for each service and implementing fallback strategies (e.g., Brave Search for flights if Amadeus failed).<br/>
2.  **Entity Extraction Nuances:** Ensured accurate LLM-based entity extraction from user prompts through iterative prompt engineering and extensive testing with various travel-related queries.<br/>
3.  **Cross-Platform Dependencies:** Managed the Node.js dependency for the Airbnb tool by providing clear setup instructions in the project's `README.md`.<br/>

Goals for Next Two Weeks:<br/>
1.  Finalize and submit the project report documentation for the AI-Powered Conversational Travel Assistant.<br/>
2.  Share the completed walkthrough video with stakeholders.<br/>
3.  Begin addressing known limitations and areas for improvement as outlined in the project README, such as refining entity extraction for local searches and exploring flexible date searches for flights.<br/>
4.  Gather initial user feedback on the travel assistant for UI/UX improvements.<br/>

Any Resources or Assistance Needed:<br/>
1.  Would appreciate continued guidance and support from Dev Shah, especially for architectural decisions and resolving any complex technical challenges that arise during the next phase of enhancements.<br/>
2.  Access to premium API tokens (e.g., Groq premium) would be beneficial to mitigate rate limiting issues during further development and testing.<br/>

Hours Contributed During This Period:<br/>
I spent 20 hours over the last two weeks working on the AI-Powered Conversational Travel Assistant, focusing on completing the implementation, creating the demo video, and drafting the report.<br/>
