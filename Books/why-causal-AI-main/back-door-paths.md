# Back Door Paths

## **Backdoor Paths in Causal Inference: Theory, Mathematics, and Practical Applications**

***

### **1. Introduction to Backdoor Paths**

In causal inference, a **backdoor path** refers to a **non-causal pathway** between a treatment (or exposure) variable XX and an outcome variable YY. These paths "sneak" behind the causal relationship, often through common causes or confounders, potentially introducing bias into the estimation of the causal effect.

#### **Why the term "Backdoor"?**

* **Causal (front-door) paths:** Flow **from** treatment XX **to** outcome YY: X‚ÜíYX \rightarrow Y
* **Backdoor paths:** Flow **into** the treatment variable (i.e., an arrow points toward XX).

Backdoor paths represent **non-causal associations** that **must be blocked** to isolate the true causal effect of XX on YY.

***

### **2. The Role of Backdoor Paths in Bias**

If a backdoor path is **open**, it creates a **spurious association** between XX and YY that does not represent causality.

#### **Why block backdoor paths?**

* **To remove confounding bias:** Confounders create non-causal associations.
* **To ensure that observed relationships reflect true causality.**

#### **Example of a Simple Backdoor Path:**

X‚ÜêZ‚ÜíYX \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y

* ZZ is a **confounder**, affecting both XX and YY.
* **Unblocked backdoor path:** Creates bias in estimating X‚ÜíYX \rightarrow Y.
* **Solution:** **Condition on ZZ** to block the backdoor path.

***

### **3. Backdoor Criterion: Formal Definition**

A set of variables Z\mathbf{Z} satisfies the **backdoor criterion** relative to an ordered pair (X,Y)(X, Y) if:

1. **No node in Z\mathbf{Z} is a descendant of XX** (to avoid blocking causal effects).
2. Z\mathbf{Z} **blocks every path** between XX and YY that contains an arrow into XX (i.e., all backdoor paths).

***

### **4. Mathematical Formulation of Backdoor Adjustment**

#### **Backdoor Adjustment Formula:**

If a set of variables Z\mathbf{Z} satisfies the backdoor criterion:

P(Y‚à£do(X))=‚àëzP(Y‚à£X,Z=z)P(Z=z)P(Y \mid \text{do}(X)) = \sum\_{\mathbf{z\}} P(Y \mid X, \mathbf{Z}=\mathbf{z}) P(\mathbf{Z}=\mathbf{z})

#### **Interpretation:**

* **Left-hand side:** P(Y‚à£do(X))P(Y \mid \text{do}(X)) represents the **causal effect** of XX on YY.
* **Right-hand side:** Adjusts for confounding by **conditioning** on Z\mathbf{Z}.

***

### **5. Identifying Backdoor Paths in DAGs**

#### **What is a DAG?**

* **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):** Represents causal relationships between variables.
* **Nodes:** Variables
* **Directed Edges (Arrows):** Causal effects

#### **How to find backdoor paths:**

1. Start from the treatment node XX.
2. Identify all **paths from XX to YY** that **enter XX** through an arrow.
3. These are the **backdoor paths** that must be **blocked**.

***

### **6. Blocking Backdoor Paths**

#### **How to block a backdoor path?**

‚úÖ **Condition on confounders** along the backdoor path.\
‚ùå **Do not condition on mediators or colliders**, as it may **introduce bias**.

#### **d-Separation:**

* **d-Separation** is a graphical criterion used to determine whether a path is blocked.
* A path is **blocked** if at least one of the following is true:
  * There is a **collider** on the path that is **not conditioned on**.
  * There is a **non-collider** on the path that **is conditioned on**.

***

### **7. Common Backdoor Path Structures**

#### **a. Confounding Backdoor Path:**

X‚ÜêZ‚ÜíYX \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y

* **Problem:** Confounding bias due to ZZ.
* **Solution:** **Condition on ZZ** to block the path.

***

#### **b. Collider Path (Do Not Condition On Colliders):**

X‚ÜíC‚ÜêYX \rightarrow C \leftarrow Y

* CC is a **collider**.
* **Without conditioning:** Path is **blocked**.
* **Conditioning on CC:** **Opens** the path and introduces bias! ‚ùå

***

#### **c. Mediator Path (Avoid Conditioning When Estimating Total Effect):**

X‚ÜíM‚ÜíYX \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y

* **Goal:** Estimate total causal effect of XX on YY.
* **Do not condition on MM** when estimating the total effect.

***

### **8. Surrogate Confounders**

#### **What if the true confounder is unobserved?**

* If the confounder ZZ is **unobserved**, look for its **children** (surrogate confounders).

#### **Example:**

X‚ÜêU‚ÜíY,U‚ÜíWX \leftarrow U \rightarrow Y, \quad U \rightarrow W

* **UU** is unobserved confounder.
* **Solution:** Condition on WW (child of UU) to **partially block** the backdoor path.

***

### **9. Practical Example**

#### **Scenario:**

You want to estimate the causal effect of **smoking (XX)** on **lung cancer (YY)**.

#### **Backdoor Path:**

X‚ÜêZ‚ÜíYX \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y

Where:

* Z=Z = Genetic predisposition (common cause of both smoking and cancer).

#### **Without Adjustment:**

P(Y‚à£X)P(Y \mid X) includes both causal and confounding effects.

#### **With Adjustment Using Backdoor Criterion:**

P(Y‚à£do(X))=‚àëzP(Y‚à£X,Z=z)P(Z=z)P(Y \mid \text{do}(X)) = \sum\_z P(Y \mid X, Z=z) P(Z=z)

Conditioning on ZZ **blocks** the backdoor path and isolates the **causal effect** of smoking on lung cancer.

### **10. Backdoor vs. Front-Door Paths**

| **Aspect**     | **Backdoor Path**                              | **Front-Door Path**                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Non-causal path entering the treatment node XX | Causal path passing through a mediator MM |
| **Goal**       | Remove confounding bias                        | Estimate causal effect through mediators  |
| **Method**     | Condition on confounders (backdoor criterion)  | Use front-door adjustment formula         |
| **Example**    | X‚ÜêZ‚ÜíYX \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y              | X‚ÜíM‚ÜíYX \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y        |

***

### **11. Step-by-Step Approach to Backdoor Adjustment**

1. **Draw the DAG:** Map out the causal relationships.
2. **Identify all paths from XX to YY:** Focus on those entering XX.
3. **Classify paths:**
   * **Front-door paths:** Represent causal effects.
   * **Backdoor paths:** Represent non-causal associations.
4. **Block backdoor paths:**
   * Condition on appropriate confounders.
   * Avoid conditioning on colliders or mediators when estimating total effect.

***

### **12. Important Considerations**

üö´ **Do not condition on descendants of the treatment:**\
This blocks the causal path and biases the estimate.

üö´ **Avoid conditioning on colliders:**\
Opens non-causal paths and introduces bias.

‚úÖ **Condition on common causes (confounders):**\
Effectively blocks backdoor paths.

### **13. Real-World Application Example: Medical Study**

#### **Research Question:**

Does a new medication (XX) reduce blood pressure (YY)?

#### **Potential Backdoor Path:**

X‚ÜêZ‚ÜíY,Z=patient‚Äôs ageX \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y, \quad Z = \text{patient's age}

* Older patients may be more likely to receive medication and also have higher blood pressure.
* **Solution:** Control for age (ZZ) to block the backdoor path.

**Backdoor Adjustment Formula:**

P(Y‚à£do(X))=‚àëzP(Y‚à£X,Z=z)P(Z=z)P(Y \mid \text{do}(X)) = \sum\_z P(Y \mid X, Z=z) P(Z=z)

***

### **14. Backdoor Criterion in Practice: R Code Example**

```r
library(dagitty)

# Define the DAG
dag <- dagitty("dag {
  X [exposure]
  Y [outcome]
  Z [confounder]
  X <- Z -> Y
}")

# Identify adjustment set
adjustmentSets(dag, exposure = "X", outcome = "Y")
```

**Output:** {Z}\\{Z\\}\
‚úÖ Adjusting for ZZ blocks the backdoor path between XX and YY.

***
