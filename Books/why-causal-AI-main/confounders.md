## **Confounders in Causal Inference: Theory, Mathematics, and Applications**

### **What is a Confounder?**

A **confounder** is a variable that acts as a **common cause** of both the treatment/exposure (XX) and the outcome (YY). Confounders create **spurious associations** between XX and YY, potentially leading to **biased causal effect estimates** if not properly controlled.

***

#### **Formal Definition**

A variable ZZ is a confounder of the relationship between XX (treatment) and YY (outcome) if it meets the following three conditions:

1. **Association with the Exposure:** P(Z∣X=1)≠P(Z∣X=0)P(Z \mid X=1) \neq P(Z \mid X=0)
2. **Association with the Outcome (Conditional on Exposure):** P(Y∣Z=z,X=x)≠P(Y∣Z=z′,X=x)P(Y \mid Z=z, X=x) \neq P(Y \mid Z=z', X=x)
3. **Not a Mediator:** ZZ is **not on the causal pathway** from XX to YY. Formally: X↛Z→Y(violates confounder condition)X \nrightarrow Z \rightarrow Y \quad \text{(violates confounder condition)}

***

### **Confounding Effect**

The **confounding effect** occurs when the relationship between XX and YY is distorted due to the influence of ZZ.

* **Without adjusting for ZZ:** The observed association between XX and YY may be **biased**.
* **After adjusting for ZZ:** The **true causal effect** of XX on YY can be estimated.

***

### **Mathematical Representation**

#### **Observed Association (Biased Estimate)**

The total association between XX and YY:

Association=P(Y=1∣X=1)−P(Y=1∣X=0)\text{Association} = P(Y=1 \mid X=1) - P(Y=1 \mid X=0)

This quantity may include both the **causal effect** and **bias from confounding**.

***

#### **Causal Effect (Without Confounding)**

If there were no confounders:

Causal Effect=E\[Y(1)]−E\[Y(0)]\text{Causal Effect} = E\[Y^{(1)}] - E\[Y^{(0)}]

where Y(1)Y^{(1)} and Y(0)Y^{(0)} are the **potential outcomes** under treatment and no treatment, respectively.

***

#### **Confounding Bias**

The **bias due to confounding** is:

Bias=\[P(Y=1∣X=1)−P(Y=1∣X=0)]−\[E\[Y(1)]−E\[Y(0)]]\text{Bias} = \[P(Y=1 \mid X=1) - P(Y=1 \mid X=0)] - \[E\[Y^{(1)}] - E\[Y^{(0)}]]

***

#### **Backdoor Criterion and Adjustment**

**Backdoor paths** are non-causal paths that create spurious associations. To block these paths, we adjust for confounders.

The **backdoor criterion** states that a set of variables ZZ satisfies the criterion if:

1. No variable in ZZ is a **descendant** of XX.
2. ZZ **blocks all backdoor paths** from XX to YY.

If ZZ meets this criterion:

P(Y∣do(X))=∑zP(Y∣X,Z=z)P(Z=z)P(Y \mid \text{do}(X)) = \sum\_{z} P(Y \mid X, Z=z)P(Z=z)

This adjustment **removes confounding bias**.

***

### **Graphical Interpretation: DAGs and Confounders**

#### **Causal DAG with Confounding**

X←Z→YX \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y

Here:

* ZZ is the **confounder**.
* It creates a **backdoor path**: X←Z→YX \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y.

***

#### **Example: Medication and Stroke**

* XX: Medication
* YY: Stroke occurrence
* ZZ: History of heart disease (confounder)

DAG:

X←Z→YX \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y

* Patients with a history of heart disease are more likely to take medication (Z→XZ \to X) and more likely to have a stroke (Z→YZ \to Y).
* Not adjusting for ZZ inflates the perceived benefit or harm of the medication.

**Backdoor path:**

X←Z→YX \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y

#### **Solution:**

**Adjust for ZZ**:

P(Y∣do(X))=∑zP(Y∣X,Z=z)P(Z=z)P(Y \mid \text{do}(X)) = \sum\_{z} P(Y \mid X, Z=z)P(Z=z)

This removes the spurious association induced by ZZ.

***

### **Mathematical Methods to Control Confounding**

#### **1. Stratification**

Divide data into **strata** based on confounder values.

For a binary confounder ZZ:

P(Y∣do(X))=P(Y∣X,Z=0)P(Z=0)+P(Y∣X,Z=1)P(Z=1)P(Y \mid \text{do}(X)) = P(Y \mid X, Z=0)P(Z=0) + P(Y \mid X, Z=1)P(Z=1)

**Advantages:**

* Simple to implement.
* Works well for discrete confounders.

**Limitations:**

* Infeasible with many confounders or continuous variables.

***

#### **2. Standardization**

Adjust outcome probabilities by weighting with the distribution of the confounder:

P(Y∣do(X))=∑zP(Y∣X,Z=z)P(Z=z)P(Y \mid \text{do}(X)) = \sum\_{z} P(Y \mid X, Z=z)P(Z=z)

***

#### **3. Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)**

Weights samples to simulate a randomized trial:

w=1P(X∣Z)w = \frac{1}{P(X \mid Z)}

Adjusted causal effect:

θ^=∑iwiYi∑iwi\hat{\theta} = \frac{\sum\_i w\_i Y\_i}{\sum\_i w\_i}

***

#### **4. Regression Adjustment**

Fit a model including confounders:

Y=β0+β1X+β2Z+ϵY = \beta\_0 + \beta\_1 X + \beta\_2 Z + \epsilon

Interpret β1\beta\_1 as the **causal effect** of XX after controlling for ZZ.

***

#### **5. Propensity Score Matching**

Estimate the **propensity score**:

e(Z)=P(X=1∣Z)e(Z) = P(X=1 \mid Z)

Match individuals with similar propensity scores to compare outcomes.

### **Common Confounders in Practice**

| **Domain**      | **Confounder Example** | **Effect**                                                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Healthcare      | Age                    | Older patients more likely to be treated and have worse outcomes |
| Social Sciences | Income                 | Affects both education and job outcomes                          |
| Epidemiology    | Smoking                | Confounds the relationship between coffee consumption and cancer |
| Marketing       | Seasonality            | Influences both advertising and sales                            |

***

### **Confounding vs. Other Biases**

| **Bias Type**  | **Cause**                          | **Solution**              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Confounding    | Common cause of X and Y            | Adjust for confounders    |
| Collider Bias  | Conditioning on a collider         | Avoid adjusting colliders |
| Selection Bias | Conditioning on selection variable | Careful study design      |

***

### **Detecting Confounders**

#### **Checklist for Confounders:**

1. **Associated with Exposure:** P(Z∣X=1)≠P(Z∣X=0)P(Z \mid X=1) \neq P(Z \mid X=0)
2. **Associated with Outcome (Conditional on Exposure):** P(Y∣Z=z,X=x)≠P(Y∣Z=z′,X=x)P(Y \mid Z=z, X=x) \neq P(Y \mid Z=z', X=x)
3. **Not on the Causal Pathway:**\
   ZZ should **not be a mediator**.

***

### **Confounding vs. Mediation**

| **Feature**  | **Confounder**           | **Mediator**                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Relationship | Common cause of X and Y  | Variable on causal pathway X → M → Y         |
| Action       | Adjust to block backdoor | Do **not** adjust if estimating total effect |

***

### **Example Problem**

#### **Scenario:**

Researchers investigate the effect of exercise (XX) on blood pressure (YY).

* ZZ: Diet quality (confounder)
* ZZ affects both exercise likelihood and blood pressure.

#### **Without Adjustment:**

P(Y=1∣X=1)−P(Y=1∣X=0)=−0.15(possibly biased)P(Y=1 \mid X=1) - P(Y=1 \mid X=0) = -0.15 \quad (\text{possibly biased})

#### **After Adjusting for Diet (ZZ) via Standardization:**

P(Y∣do(X))=−0.10(reduced bias)P(Y \mid \text{do}(X)) = -0.10 \quad (\text{reduced bias})

***

### **Challenges in Handling Confounding**

* **Hidden Confounding:** Unmeasured confounders can still bias estimates.
* **Residual Confounding:** Incomplete adjustment leads to leftover bias.
* **Overadjustment:** Adjusting for mediators or colliders creates new biases.

***

### **Summary**

✅ **Confounders distort causal relationships** between treatment and outcome.\
✅ **Adjusting for confounders** via stratification, regression, or matching **removes bias**.\
✅ Use **causal DAGs** and **backdoor criterion** to identify confounders.\
✅ Avoid confusing **confounders with colliders or mediators**.

***

### **Conclusion**

Confounding is a **major source of bias** in causal inference. Proper identification and adjustment are essential to estimate **true causal effects**. Always use a combination of **causal graphs, domain knowledge, and statistical techniques** to handle confounding effectively.
