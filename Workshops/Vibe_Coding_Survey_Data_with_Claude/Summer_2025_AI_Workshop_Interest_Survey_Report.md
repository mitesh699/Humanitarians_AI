- AI Image Generation: 100% high interest (among experts)

These trends suggest that creative AI applications hold broad appeal across all knowledge levels, while beginners gravitate toward visual and audio applications that offer accessible entry points. Advanced users maintain high interest in creative applications while also seeking specialized knowledge in academic and programming domains.

This analysis supports a tiered workshop approach, with specialized tracks for different knowledge levels and strong emphasis on creative applications that appeal to all participants.

## Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive survey results, the following recommendations are made for implementing AI workshops at Northeastern University:

1. **Workshop Topic Prioritization**: Begin with the most popular workshop topics and organize them in tiers:
   - Tier 1 (Highest Interest): "AI Agents and Automation" and "AI for Programmers"
   - Tier 2 (High Interest): "AI for Personal Branding," "AI Ethics and Critical Thinking," and "AI Video Production"
   - Tier 3 (Moderate Interest): Remaining workshop topics

2. **Knowledge-Level Tracks**: Implement parallel workshop tracks for different AI knowledge levels:
   - Beginner Track: Focus on accessible, visual AI applications (image generation, video production)
   - Intermediate Track: Core tools and academic applications
   - Advanced Track: Technical implementation, agent development, and specialized applications

3. **Additional Topic Offerings**: Based on specific requests, add specialized workshops on:
   - RAG systems and LLM fine-tuning
   - AI infrastructure and application development
   - Domain-specific AI applications (healthcare, finance, project management)

4. **Format Implementation**: Prioritize a hybrid approach (46% preference) that combines online and in-person elements, with online-only options (33% preference) available for those who cannot attend in person.

5. **Session Scheduling**:
   - Primary Sessions: Weekday afternoons (52% preference) and evenings (47% preference)
   - Secondary Sessions: Weekend afternoons (35% preference)
   - Session Length: 1.5 to 2 hours (65% combined preference)

6. **Summer Programming**: Develop a comprehensive summer 2025 workshop series, given the strong interest (63% "definitely" interested, 22% "probably" interested).

7. **Series Structure**: Design a progressive curriculum with 4-6 workshops per knowledge track, as most respondents expressed interest in attending multiple sessions.

8. **Promotional Strategy**: Target promotion to the Computer Science/IT and Engineering departments, with secondary outreach to Business/Management and Arts/Design fields.

9. **Location Accessibility**: Ensure that in-person components are held on campus or within Boston city limits to accommodate the 75% of respondents located in these areas.

10. **Cost Structure**: Consider implementing a sliding scale fee structure or offering scholarships to address cost barriers, the most commonly cited obstacle to participation (60% of respondents).

11. **Prerequisites Communication**: Clearly communicate any prerequisites for workshops and consider offering introductory sessions for the 32% of respondents who cited lack of prerequisites as a barrier.

12. **Creative Applications Emphasis**: Highlight creative applications of AI (image, video, music) in marketing materials, as these topics showed broad appeal across knowledge levels.

## Conclusion

The survey results demonstrate strong interest in AI workshops among the Northeastern University community, particularly among graduate students in technology-related fields. Respondents are primarily motivated by career advancement (82%) and staying current with technology (78%), with programming/coding (85%), academic research (76%), and writing assistance (74%) being the most common applications of AI.

The workshop interest analysis provides clear guidance on which topics are most in demand. "AI Agents and Automation" and "AI for Programmers" showed the highest interest levels, with over 70% and 69% of respondents indicating they were "very" or "extremely" interested, respectively. This aligns well with the finding that programming/coding is the most common current use of AI among respondents.

A particularly valuable insight is the relationship between AI knowledge level and workshop interests. While creative applications like AI image and video generation appeal broadly across knowledge levels, beginners show stronger interest in accessible visual and audio applications, while advanced users maintain high interest in these areas while also seeking specialized knowledge in technical domains. This suggests a multi-track approach to workshops would be most effective.

The logistical preferences are clear, with a hybrid format (46%) being most popular, followed by online-only (33%). Most respondents prefer weekday afternoons and evenings, with sessions lasting 1.5 to 2 hours. There is strong interest in summer 2025 programming (85% "definitely" or "probably" interested), and most respondents (87%) anticipate attending multiple workshops.

The additional topic requests reveal interest in cutting-edge AI applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), and AI agents, as well as domain-specific applications in areas such as healthcare, finance, and project management. This suggests an appetite for both theoretical understanding and practical applications of AI technology.

By addressing the identified barriers to participation, particularly cost (60%) and time constraints (54%), and by implementing the recommended workshop format and scheduling, Northeastern University can effectively meet the AI upskilling needs of its community. The strong interest and detailed preferences expressed in this survey provide a solid foundation for developing a comprehensive AI workshop program that will serve the university community well.
