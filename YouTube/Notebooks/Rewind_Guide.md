## What is Rewind AI?

Rewind AI is a productivity tool designed to help users record, search, and revisit their digital activities on a computer. It works by continuously capturing and indexing everything displayed on the screen—from meetings and browser content to application interactions—making it easy to recall important moments without manual note-taking. By creating a searchable database of your screen activities, Rewind AI becomes a digital memory assistant, helping users improve workflow efficiency and minimize information loss.

## Key Features

### 1. **Screen Recording and Indexing**

Rewind AI captures your screen activities and audio interactions, storing them securely on your local device. This information is indexed in real-time, making it possible to search through hours of past interactions effortlessly. Whether you’re looking for a web page, a document, or meeting content, Rewind AI makes retrieval fast and straightforward.

### 2. **Powerful Search Functionality**

The tool allows users to search for past activities using keywords, timestamps, or application contexts. This functionality resembles searching through an archive of your daily digital footprint. Advanced filters can narrow down results, ensuring users find exactly what they need.

### 3. **Data Privacy and Security**

Unlike cloud-based tools, Rewind AI stores all data locally on your machine. The company emphasizes user privacy by not uploading your recordings to external servers. This local-first approach provides users with full control over their sensitive information while mitigating concerns about potential data breaches.

### 4. **Audio Transcription**

Rewind AI provides real-time transcription for audio inputs such as virtual meetings and calls, allowing users to search through spoken content easily. These transcripts are stored alongside visual recordings to create a holistic view of user interactions.

### 5. **Integrations**

The tool integrates with popular applications such as Zoom, Google Meet, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and other workplace productivity tools to capture meaningful interactions. These integrations ensure that no crucial information is lost, regardless of the platform used.

### 6. **Time Travel Feature**

This feature allows users to "rewind" to specific moments in their workflow history, much like using a DVR. Whether you need to recover a lost idea or revisit a step in your development process, this function provides unparalleled access to past activities.

### 7. **Customizable Recording Settings**
