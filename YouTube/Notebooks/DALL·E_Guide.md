# Understanding DALL·E: How to Use OpenAI’s AI-Powered Image Generator

DALL·E is an advanced artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI that generates images from textual descriptions. It bridges the gap between language and visual creation, enabling users to produce unique, creative, and highly detailed images by simply describing them in natural language. This guide explains how DALL·E works, its applications, and step-by-step instructions to help you use it effectively.

## What is DALL·E?

DALL·E is named after Salvador Dalí, the surrealist artist, and Pixar’s WALL·E, reflecting its creative and technical nature. It is powered by GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology. Unlike GPT-3 or GPT-4, which focuses on generating text, DALL·E is trained to generate realistic and creative images from textual prompts.
