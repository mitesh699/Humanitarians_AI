# Open R1: Reproducing DeepSeek-R1 in Open Source

## What is Open R1?
Open R1 is an open-source initiative led by Hugging Face, aiming to replicate and build upon DeepSeek-R1, a reasoning model developed by DeepSeek AI. The project focuses on creating accessible tools and resources for training, evaluating, and enhancing reasoning models.

## Project Goals and Roadmap

### Goals
- **Reproduction of DeepSeek-R1**: Faithfully replicate the architecture and performance of DeepSeek-R1 to ensure accessibility for the research community.
- **Open-Source Development**: Provide transparent and collaborative development processes, encouraging contributions from researchers and developers.
- **Enhancement and Innovation**: Build upon the original model by introducing improvements and new features based on community feedback and ongoing research.

### Roadmap
1. **Initial Replication**: Reproduce the original DeepSeek-R1 model to establish a baseline.
2. **Benchmarking**: Evaluate the replicated model against standard reasoning tasks to assess fidelity.
3. **Optimization**: Implement improvements based on evaluation outcomes and community input.

## Core Components of Open R1
- **Model Architecture**: The foundational structure replicating DeepSeek-R1's design.
- **Training Scripts**: Automated processes for model training, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Generalized Proximal Policy Optimization (GRPO).
- **Evaluation Tools**: Mechanisms to assess model performance across various reasoning benchmarks.
- **Data Generation Utilities**: Tools for creating synthetic datasets to enhance training diversity and robustness.

## Training Scripts

### Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
Refines the model using labeled datasets to improve accuracy.

### Generalized Proximal Policy Optimization (GRPO)
An advanced reinforcement learning technique to enhance reasoning capabilities.

### Evaluation Scripts
Automated testing against established benchmarks to measure performance.

### Synthetic Data Generation
Creating artificial data to supplement training and address data scarcity.

python src/open_r1/train_sft.py
```

## Evaluating Models on Reasoning Benchmarks
```sh
# Run evaluation scripts
python src/open_r1/evaluate.py

# Analyze results
# Compare outcomes against baseline metrics
```

## Generating Synthetic Data for Training
```sh
