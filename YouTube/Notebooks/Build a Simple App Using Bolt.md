This tutorial demonstrates how to use Bolt.New to build a **Work Session Tracker App**. Bolt’s intuitive drag-and-drop interface, real-time updates, API integrations, and robust analytics make it the perfect platform for creating functional applications.

---

## **2. Bolt.New Features Overview**

Before we begin, let’s explore the Bolt features we’ll use:

1. **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Quickly design app components without coding.  
2. **Pre-built Components**: Use timers, forms, charts, and tables.  
3. **API Integration**: Seamlessly connect with tools like Make, Supabase, and more.  
4. **Analytics Tools**: Build dashboards for trends and insights.  
5. **Flexible Deployment**: Publish apps for web or mobile with one click.

## **3. Creating Your Work Session Tracker**

### **Step 1: Building the Timer**

1. **Add the Timer Component**:  
   - Drag the **Timer** component from the library.  
   - Configure the default duration (e.g., 25 minutes).  
   - Add buttons: **Start**, **Pause**, **Reset**.  
   - Set up a notification to alert users when the timer ends.  

2. **Data Binding**:  
   - Bind the timer’s output to a session variable for real-time tracking.

### **Step 2: Adding the Task Logger**

1. **Drag and Drop a Form Component**:  
   - Add fields:  
     - **Task Name** (text input).  
     - **Task Description** (multi-line input).  
     - **Time Spent** (auto-filled with timer data).  

2. **Save Task Button**:  
   - Use Bolt’s action builder to append task details to the session data array.  

3. **Test and Preview**:  
   - Use Bolt’s live preview to test the task logging workflow.

---

### **Step 3: Designing the Session Summary**

1. **Session Summary Page**:  
   - Use a **Table** component to display saved tasks with fields like task name, description, and time spent.  

2. **Save Session Button**:  
   - Configure this button to store session data in Bolt’s built-in database or connect it to Supabase.

---

## **4. Visualizing with Bolt Analytics**

1. **Add a Dashboard**:  
   - Use **Pie Charts** to display time distribution across tasks.  
   - Add a **Bar Graph** to show task frequencies.  

2. **Insights Section**:  
   - Highlight top 3 tasks by time spent.  
   - Suggest tasks for delegation using conditional logic.  

3. **Real-Time Updates**:  
   - Enable real-time updates so the analytics reflect changes instantly.

## **5. Integrating External APIs**

### **Using Make**
1. **Why Use Make?**  
   - Automate workflows like sending session data to email, Slack, or Google Sheets.  

2. **How to Integrate**:  
   - Open Bolt’s **API Integration Panel**.  
   - Add Make’s webhook URL to Bolt’s action builder.  
   - Configure actions to trigger data updates or send notifications when a session ends.  

3. **Example Workflow**:  
   - Send session summaries automatically to a Slack channel or Google Sheets for tracking.

### **Using Supabase**
1. **Why Use Supabase?**  
   - Use Supabase as a scalable backend to store and manage session data.  

2. **How to Integrate**:  
   - Navigate to Bolt’s **API Connector** and input Supabase API details (URL, keys).  
   - Configure API actions to perform CRUD operations:  
     - **Create**: Save session data in a Supabase table.  
     - **Read**: Retrieve previous sessions for analytics.  
     - **Update**: Edit session details as needed.  
     - **Delete**: Remove old session data.  

3. **Example Workflow**:  
   - Log session data into Supabase and retrieve it for dashboard analytics.

---

## **6. Deploying and Testing with Bolt**

1. **Test the App**:  
   - Use Bolt’s test environment to simulate a session:  
     - Start a timer, log tasks, save the session, and check analytics.  

2. **Deploy the App**:  
   - Click `Deploy` in Bolt.  
   - Choose deployment as a **web app** or **mobile app**.  
   - Set access permissions (private or public).
