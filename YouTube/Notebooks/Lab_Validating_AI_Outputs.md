### **Instructions**

#### **1. Initial Query and Response Collection (20 points)**
1. Select a research question or academic query in a field of your choice (e.g., history, science, mathematics).
2. Use at least three different AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Bard) to generate responses.
3. Document the query, the settings (if applicable), and the raw outputs.  

**Deliverable:**  
A table summarizing the tools, the query, and the outputs.

| **Tool**     | **Query**                                 | **Output Summary**                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| ChatGPT      | "Explain photosynthesis in simple terms." | Plants convert sunlight, water, and CO2…  |
| Claude       | "Explain photosynthesis in simple terms." | Photosynthesis is the process where...    |
| Bard         | "Explain photosynthesis in simple terms." | The mechanism of photosynthesis involves… |

**Scoring Rubric:**  
- 10 points: Query is clear and well-documented.  
- 10 points: Outputs from three different tools are accurately collected.

---

#### **2. Accuracy and Fact-Checking (30 points)**
1. Verify the factual accuracy of the AI outputs using authoritative sources (e.g., peer-reviewed papers, textbooks, reputable websites).
2. Highlight any incorrect or fabricated information.  
3. Document the sources you used for verification.

**Deliverable:**  
A table or annotated document showing the claims, their accuracy, and supporting sources.

| **Claim**                             | **Tool**  | **Accuracy** | **Verification Source**                |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| "Photosynthesis produces glucose."    | ChatGPT   | Correct      | Biology textbook, Chapter 5.          |
| "Photosynthesis produces energy."     | Claude    | Partially Correct | National Geographic article.       |
| "Photosynthesis involves nitrogen."   | Bard      | Incorrect    | Verified using PubMed research paper. |

**Scoring Rubric:**  
- 15 points: Detailed and thorough fact-checking.  
- 10 points: Clear identification of accurate and inaccurate claims.  
- 5 points: Use of authoritative sources.

---

#### **3. Bias and Hallucination Analysis (20 points)**
1. Identify biases or hallucinations in the responses.  
   - Example of bias: Overrepresentation of Western perspectives.  
   - Example of hallucination: Fabricated citations or facts.  
2. Suggest how these issues could be mitigated (e.g., prompt adjustment, multi-tool comparison).

**Deliverable:**  
A written analysis (300–400 words) addressing biases and hallucinations in the outputs.

**Scoring Rubric:**  
- 10 points: Clear examples of biases and hallucinations identified.  
- 10 points: Practical suggestions for mitigation.

---

#### **4. Documentation and Citation (10 points)**
1. Document your findings using a structured format:
   - Include the original query.
   - Summarize outputs, fact-checking results, and analyses.
2. Cite all sources used for verification and analysis.

**Deliverable:**  
A formatted report with proper citations (APA or MLA format).

**Scoring Rubric:**  
- 5 points: Comprehensive and well-organized documentation.  
- 5 points: Proper citation of sources.

---

#### **5. Reflection and Improvement Suggestions (20 points)**
1. Reflect on the strengths and limitations of the tools you evaluated.  
2. Suggest how AI tools could be improved for academic use.  
3. Discuss the ethical considerations of using AI-generated content in academic work.

**Deliverable:**  
A reflection essay (400–500 words).

**Scoring Rubric:**  
- 10 points: Insightful discussion of tool strengths and limitations.  
- 5 points: Thoughtful suggestions for improvement.  
- 5 points: Consideration of ethical implications.
