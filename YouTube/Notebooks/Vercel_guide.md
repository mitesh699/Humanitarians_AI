# Deployment on Vercel

## Introduction to Vercel

Vercel is a powerful and user-friendly platform designed for developers to deploy websites and web applications effortlessly. It supports static sites, serverless functions, and advanced frameworks like Next.js. Vercel ensures seamless integration with Git-based workflows, enabling continuous deployment and collaboration. With built-in analytics, automatic scaling, and global content delivery, Vercel optimizes the performance and reliability of your projects.

This document outlines the step-by-step process for deploying your blog website on Vercel. Whether you're deploying a static site or a dynamic application, these instructions will guide you through the setup and deployment process without relying on CLI commands.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:

1. **A Git Repository:** Your blog website's code should be in a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
2. **A Vercel Account:** Create an account at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) if you don't have one.
3. **Your Project Ready:** Make sure your blog website is fully functional locally.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project for Deployment

1. **Verify Project Readiness**:
   - If you’re working with a static site (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), make sure all files are organized and functional.
   - For dynamic frameworks (e.g., React, Next.js), ensure that your development environment is set up correctly with the required dependencies installed using a package manager like `npm` or `yarn`.

2. **Test Locally**:
   - Run your project locally in production mode to confirm it behaves as expected.
   - Resolve any issues, such as broken links, missing assets, or JavaScript errors.

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Identify sensitive data your project needs, such as API keys, database URLs, or authentication tokens. These must not be hardcoded in your codebase.
   - Create a list of environment variables and ensure they are used in your code.

## Step 2: Link Your Repository to Vercel

1. **Sign In to Vercel**:
   - Visit [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and log in using a preferred authentication method (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

2. **Import Your Project**:
   - After logging in, click on the `New Project` button.
   - Vercel will prompt you to connect a Git provider. Authorize Vercel to access your repositories if you haven’t done so already.
   - Select the repository that contains your blog website.'

3. **Initial Setup**:
   - Vercel will scan your repository to detect the type of project. For instance:
     - **Static Site**: No framework detected; deployment of static files.
     - **Framework**: Framework-specific setup, such as Next.js, Nuxt.js, or React.
   - If Vercel does not auto-detect, manually select the framework or static site option and specify the build and output directories.

---

## Step 3: Configure Build and Deployment Settings

1. **Specify the Build Command**:
   - Most frameworks require a build command to prepare production-ready files.
     - For example, `npm run build` for React/Next.js projects.
   - Vercel will prompt you to input this during setup if it hasn’t been automatically detected.

2. **Define the Output Directory**:
   - For static websites, this is usually a folder named `build`, `dist`, or similar.
   - Make sure this directory matches the one specified in your framework or project settings.

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Go to the `Environment Variables` section in the Vercel dashboard for your project.
   - Add each key-value pair required for your website to function. For example:
     - `API_KEY: xxxxxxx`
     - `DATABASE_URL: your-database-url`

   - Avoid hardcoding these values directly into your project for security reasons.

## Step 4: Deploy Your Blog Website

1. **Start Deployment**:
   - Once all configurations are complete, click the `Deploy` button in Vercel.

2. **Monitor Deployment Logs**:
   - A progress screen will display the logs of your deployment.
   - Look for errors or warnings during this step, as they may indicate issues with your build process or configuration.

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - After successful deployment, you’ll be provided with a live URL (`https://blog-drab-zeta-48.vercel.app/`).

   - Open the URL in your browser to ensure the website is functioning correctly.

## Step 5: Add a Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **Navigate to the Domain Settings**:
   - Go to the `Domains` tab in your project settings on Vercel.

2. **Add Your Custom Domain**:
   - Input your custom domain name (e.g., `www.yourblog.com`).
   - Follow the instructions to update your domain’s DNS records. Typically, you’ll need to:
     - Add an A or CNAME record pointing to Vercel’s servers.
     - Update nameservers if required by your domain registrar.

3. **Verify and Secure the Domain**:
   - Once the DNS changes propagate (can take 24-48 hours), Vercel will validate the domain.
   - Enable HTTPS for a secure connection by default.

## Step 6: Configure Advanced Options

1. **Analytics**:
   - Use Vercel’s analytics tools to track website performance, user interactions, and page load times.
   - Navigate to the Analytics tab to enable and configure.

2. **Automatic Deployments**:
   - Set up automatic deployments so changes in your linked repository automatically trigger redeployments.
   - This ensures that every update is live without manual intervention.

3. **Redirects and Rewrites**:
   - Use Vercel’s configuration to define URL redirects or rewrites, such as:
     - Redirecting old URLs to new ones.
     - Rewriting URLs for better SEO.

4. **Protected Routes**:
   - If you have admin panels or private pages, configure authentication and route protection either in your codebase or using Vercel settings.

## Step 7: Ongoing Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Monitor Logs and Errors**:
   - Use the Vercel dashboard to view error logs or build failures.
   - Regularly check for performance improvements.

2. **Update Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you periodically update project dependencies and test your updates locally.

3. **Optimize Assets**:
   - Compress images, minify JavaScript and CSS files, and remove unused code to improve website performance.
