### **Introduction to DeepSeek-R1**
DeepSeek-R1 represents a major advancement in Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically targeting **reasoning capabilities** through a unique **reinforcement learning (RL) approach**. Unlike conventional models that rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), DeepSeek-R1 **learns reasoning purely through RL**, a paradigm shift in AI training.

DeepSeek-R1 consists of two primary models:
- **DeepSeek-R1-Zero** ‚Äì Trained using **pure RL** without any SFT.
- **DeepSeek-R1** ‚Äì Uses **cold-start data and multi-stage training** to refine reasoning further.

This novel training pipeline enables DeepSeek-R1 to match, and in some cases, outperform OpenAI's **o1-1217 model** in reasoning tasks.

### **Key Innovations in DeepSeek-R1**
1. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Instead of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**
   - **DeepSeek-R1-Zero** is one of the **first LLMs to acquire reasoning ability purely through RL**, without any supervised labels.
   - Uses **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**, which avoids the need for a large critic model, making RL training more efficient.

2. **Cold-Start Data for Improved Reasoning**
   - **DeepSeek-R1** enhances DeepSeek-R1-Zero by adding **a small set of high-quality reasoning examples** before RL training.
   - This helps improve **readability**, avoid language mixing, and enhance overall model performance.

3. **Multi-Stage Training Approach**
   - **Stage 1:** Cold-start fine-tuning on curated reasoning examples.
   - **Stage 2:** Large-scale **reasoning-focused RL** to improve reasoning efficiency.
   - **Stage 3:** **Rejection sampling** and additional **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)** to refine general capabilities.
   - **Stage 4:** A second round of **RL for generalization**, ensuring the model aligns with human preferences.

4. **Distillation: Transferring Reasoning to Smaller Models**
   - The trained DeepSeek-R1 model is **distilled into smaller dense models (1.5B to 70B parameters)**.
   - These smaller models retain high reasoning capabilities while being computationally efficient.
   - Notably, the **distilled 14B model outperforms Qwen-32B**, setting a new benchmark for open-source models.
