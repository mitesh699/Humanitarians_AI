---

## **1. Getting Started with OpenAI's API**  
To use OpenAI's ChatGPT and other models programmatically, you'll need access to the API.  

### **Step 1: Sign Up & Get an API Key**  
1. Go to [OpenAI's Platform](https://platform.openai.com/signup/) and sign up (if you haven't already).  
2. Navigate to **API Keys** in the dashboard: [API Keys Page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).  
3. Click **Create new secret key** and copy it. You won't be able to see it again!  

> ðŸ”´ **Important**: Keep your API key secure. Do not share it or commit it to a public repository.  

### **Step 2: Install the OpenAI SDK**

#### **Using Python**
```python
pip install openai
```

#### **Using Node.js**
```bash
npm install openai
```

### **Step 3: Set Up Your Environment**

It's best practice to store your API key in environment variables rather than hardcoding it in your application.

#### **Python Example**
```python
import os
import openai

# Set your API key as an environment variable
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key"

# Initialize the client
client = openai.OpenAI()
```

#### **Node.js Example**
```javascript
const { OpenAI } = require('openai');

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
});
```

---

## **2. API Keys and Authentication**  

### **How to Use Your API Key**  
Your API key is required to authenticate all API requests. When making requests, pass the key in the `Authorization` header:  

#### **Example: Using Python (`requests` library)**  
```python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]
    }
)

print(response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

#### **Example: Using cURL**
```sh
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]
  }'
```

### **API Key Safety Best Practices**

- **Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables, not in code.
- **Access Control**: Restrict API key permissions to only what's needed.
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate your API keys, especially after team member departures.
- **Monitoring**: Set up usage alerts to detect unusual activity.
- **Secure Storage**: Use secrets management solutions for team environments.

## **3. Available Models and Their Capabilities**

OpenAI offers several models with different capabilities, performance levels, and price points. Here's an overview of the key models available as of May 2025:

### **GPT-4 Family**

#### **GPT-4.1**
- OpenAI's most advanced API model for code, instruction following, and long-context tasks
- 1 million token context window (approximately 750,000 words)
- Excellent for complex coding, technical writing, and data analysis
- Released April 2025

#### **GPT-4.1-mini**
- Smaller version of GPT-4.1 with reduced latency and 83% lower cost
- Matches or exceeds GPT-4o performance on many tasks
- Ideal for most production applications

#### **GPT-4.1-nano**
- OpenAI's fastest and most cost-effective model
- Perfect for classification, autocompletion, and simple generation tasks
- Best when low latency is critical

#### **GPT-4o**
- Multimodal model capable of understanding images and text
- Default model in ChatGPT as of April 2025
- Strong capabilities across writing, coding, and reasoning

### **Other Models**

- **o1, o3, o4-mini**: Reasoning-focused models with enhanced problem-solving capabilities
- **GPT-image-1**: OpenAI's latest image generation model (successor to DALL-E)
- **Audio models**: Transcription and text-to-speech capabilities (gpt-4o-transcribe, gpt-4o-audio)

### **Model Selection Guide**

| Use Case | Recommended Model |
|----------|-------------------|
| Production chat applications | GPT-4.1-mini |
| High-quality code generation | GPT-4.1 |
| Low-latency responses | GPT-4.1-nano |
| Visual content understanding | GPT-4o |
| Cost-sensitive applications | GPT-4.1-nano or GPT-3.5-turbo |

---

## **4. Pricing and Payments**  

OpenAI charges based on **tokens**, which are chunks of text. Every request consumes input tokens (your prompt) and output tokens (the model's response).  

### **Current Pricing (As of May 2025)**
| Model       | Input Tokens ($ per 1M) | Output Tokens ($ per 1M) |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **GPT-4.1** | $2.00 | $8.00 |
| **GPT-4.1-mini** | $0.40 | $1.60 |
| **GPT-4.1-nano** | $0.10 | $0.40 |
| **GPT-3.5-turbo** | $0.001 | $0.002 |

ðŸ“Œ **1,000 tokens â‰ˆ 750 words**  

### **Estimating Cost**  
If you send a request with a 500-word prompt and get a 250-word response (~1,000 tokens), using GPT-4.1:  
- **Input cost**: 1,000 tokens Ã— $0.002 = **$0.002**  
- **Output cost**: 1,000 tokens Ã— $0.008 = **$0.008**  
- **Total cost per request**: **$0.01**  

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Use GPT-4.1-nano for lower-cost applications and GPT-4.1 for high-quality responses.  

### **Cost Optimization Strategies**

1. **Use the Right Model**: Match model capabilities to your actual needs.
2. **Optimize Prompt Length**: Shorter prompts mean fewer input tokens.
3. **Cache Responses**: Store responses for common queries.
4. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple requests together when possible.
5. **Set Token Limits**: Use the max_tokens parameter to control output length.

### **Payment Methods**  
- Pay-as-you-go billing (charged monthly)  
- Free-tier credits for new users  
- Enterprise plans available for high usage  

Check your usage and billing at [OpenAI's Usage Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage).

## **5. Making API Calls**  

### **Chat Completions API (for Conversations)**  
The `chat/completions` endpoint is used for interacting with ChatGPT models.  

#### **Basic Request Example (Python)**
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke!"}
    ]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

#### **Advanced Request with Parameters**
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write me a short poem about programming."}
    ],
    temperature=0.7,  # Controls randomness (0-1)
    max_tokens=150,   # Limits the response length
    top_p=1.0,        # Alternative to temperature for controlling randomness
    frequency_penalty=0.0,  # Reduces repetition of token sequences
    presence_penalty=0.0,   # Reduces repetition of topics
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

#### **Roles in Messages**
| Role    | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **system** | Defines assistant behavior |
| **user** | User input |
| **assistant** | Model's previous responses |

#### **Managing Conversation History**

To maintain a conversation context, you need to include previous messages in each new request:

```python
# Initialize conversation
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, who are you?"}
]

# First request
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    messages=messages
)

# Add the assistant's response to the conversation history
messages.append({
    "role": "assistant", 
    "content": response.choices[0].message.content
})

# Add the user's next message
messages.append({
    "role": "user", 
    "content": "Tell me more about what you can do."
})

# Second request with the updated conversation
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    messages=messages
)
```

---

### **Embeddings API (for Text Search and Recommendations)**  
Embeddings convert text into numerical vectors for similarity searches, recommendation systems, and classification.  

#### **Example Request**
```python
response = client.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-ada-002",
    input="This is a sample text"
)
vector = response.data[0].embedding

# Calculate similarity with another embedding
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

def cosine_similarity(a, b):
    return 1 - cosine(a, b)

similarity = cosine_similarity(vector1, vector2)
print(f"Similarity score: {similarity}")  # 1.0 means identical, 0.0 means unrelated
```

#### **Building a Simple Semantic Search System**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

# Sample documents
documents = [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
    "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence",
    "Python is a popular programming language for AI",
    "The dog barked at the fox"
]

# Get embeddings for all documents
embeddings = []
for doc in documents:
    response = client.embeddings.create(
        model="text-embedding-ada-002",
        input=doc
    )
    embeddings.append(response.data[0].embedding)

# Function to find most similar documents to a query
def search(query, top_n=2):
    # Get query embedding
    query_response = client.embeddings.create(
        model="text-embedding-ada-002",
        input=query
    )
    query_embedding = query_response.data[0].embedding
    
    # Calculate similarities
    similarities = []
    for i, doc_embedding in enumerate(embeddings):
        similarity = 1 - cosine(query_embedding, doc_embedding)
        similarities.append((i, similarity))
    
    # Sort by similarity (highest first)
    similarities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    # Return top N results
    results = []
    for i, similarity in similarities[:top_n]:
        results.append({
            "document": documents[i],
            "similarity": similarity
        })
    
    return results

# Example search
results = search("AI and programming")
for result in results:
    print(f"Document: {result['document']}")
    print(f"Similarity: {result['similarity']:.4f}")
    print()
```

### **Function Calling (for API Integration)**  
Function calling allows ChatGPT to return structured outputs for API calls.  

#### **Basic Function Calling Example**
```python
functions = [
    {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather in a city",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "city": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The city name, e.g., 'San Francisco'"
                },
                "unit": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
                    "description": "The temperature unit"
                }
            },
            "required": ["city"]
        }
    }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in New York?"}
    ],
    tools=functions,
    tool_choice="auto"
)

# Check if the model wants to call a function
if response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:
    tool_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]
    function_name = tool_call.function.name
    function_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
    
    print(f"Function to call: {function_name}")
    print(f"Arguments: {function_args}")
    
    # Here you would actually call your weather API with these parameters
    # For this example, we'll just mock a response
    weather_data = {"temperature": 72, "condition": "sunny"}
    
    # Send the function result back to the model
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in New York?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": response.choices[0].message.tool_calls},
        {
            "role": "tool",
            "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
            "content": json.dumps(weather_data)
        }
    ]
    
    # Get the final response
    final_response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4.1",
        messages=messages
    )
    
    print(final_response.choices[0].message.content)
```

#### **Multiple Functions Example**

```python
functions = [
    {
        "name": "search_hotels",
        "description": "Search for hotels in a specific location",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The city or area to search in"
                },
                "check_in": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Check-in date in YYYY-MM-DD format"
                },
                "check_out": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Check-out date in YYYY-MM-DD format"
                },
                "guests": {
                    "type": "integer",
                    "description": "Number of guests"
                },
                "price_range": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "min": {"type": "number"},
                        "max": {"type": "number"}
                    },
                    "description": "Price range per night"
                }
            },
            "required": ["location"]
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "get_hotel_details",
        "description": "Get detailed information about a specific hotel",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "hotel_id": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The unique identifier of the hotel"
                }
            },
            "required": ["hotel_id"]
        }
    }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "I'm looking for a hotel in Miami for next weekend, 2 people."}
    ],
    tools=functions,
    tool_choice="auto"
)

# Process the response as in the previous example
```

#### **Using JSON Mode for Consistent Structured Output**

When you need consistent, valid JSON responses without using function calling:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that responds in JSON format."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Give me a list of 3 popular programming languages and their main use cases."}
    ],
    response_format={"type": "json_object"}
)

# The response will be a valid JSON string
json_response = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
print(json_response)
```

## **6. Advanced Features**

### **Assistants API**

The Assistants API provides a more sophisticated way to build AI applications with memory, context, and specialized tools.

#### **Key Components of the Assistants API:**

1. **Assistant**: A persistent entity with specific instructions and capabilities
2. **Thread**: A conversation session that maintains context
3. **Messages**: User inputs and assistant responses within a thread
4. **Runs**: Executions of an assistant on a thread

#### **Creating an Assistant**

```python
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
    name="Math Tutor",
    instructions="You are a math tutor. Explain concepts clearly and help with problem-solving.",
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}]
)

assistant_id = assistant.id
```

#### **Creating a Thread and Adding Messages**

```python
# Create a new thread
thread = client.beta.threads.create()

# Add a message to the thread
message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role="user",
    content="Can you help me understand how to solve quadratic equations?"
)

# Run the assistant on the thread
run = client.beta.threads.runs.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    assistant_id=assistant_id
)

# Check the run status
run_status = client.beta.threads.runs.retrieve(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    run_id=run.id
)

# When the run is completed, retrieve the messages
if run_status.status == "completed":
    messages = client.beta.threads.messages.list(
        thread_id=thread.id
    )
    
    # Print the assistant's response
    for message in messages.data:
        if message.role == "assistant":
            print(message.content[0].text.value)
```

#### **Assistants with Custom Functions**

```python
# Define a custom function
function_json = {
    "name": "calculate_mortgage_payment",
    "description": "Calculate the monthly payment for a mortgage",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "principal": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "The loan amount"
            },
            "interest_rate": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "Annual interest rate (percentage)"
            },
            "loan_term": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "Loan term in years"
            }
        },
        "required": ["principal", "interest_rate", "loan_term"]
    }
}

# Create an assistant with the custom function
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
    name="Financial Advisor",
    instructions="You are a financial advisor who helps clients with mortgage calculations.",
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[
        {"type": "function", "function": function_json}
    ]
)

# When a function is called during a run, you'll need to handle it:
def process_run(thread_id, run_id):
    run = client.beta.threads.runs.retrieve(thread_id=thread_id, run_id=run_id)
    
    if run.status == "requires_action":
        tool_calls = run.required_action.submit_tool_outputs.tool_calls
        
        tool_outputs = []
        for tool_call in tool_calls:
            function_name = tool_call.function.name
            function_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
            
            if function_name == "calculate_mortgage_payment":
                principal = function_args["principal"]
                rate = function_args["interest_rate"] / 100 / 12  # Monthly interest rate
                term = function_args["loan_term"] * 12  # Total months
                
                # Mortgage payment formula
                payment = principal * (rate * (1 + rate)**term) / ((1 + rate)**term - 1)
                
                tool_outputs.append({
                    "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
                    "output": json.dumps({"monthly_payment": round(payment, 2)})
                })
        
        # Submit the outputs back to the run
        client.beta.threads.runs.submit_tool_outputs(
            thread_id=thread_id,
            run_id=run_id,
            tool_outputs=tool_outputs
        )
        
        # Continue processing the run (recursive)
        return process_run(thread_id, run_id)
    
    elif run.status == "completed":
        messages = client.beta.threads.messages.list(thread_id=thread_id)
        return messages
    
    # Handle other statuses (in progress, failed, etc.)
    return None
```

### **Batch Processing**

For processing large volumes of requests efficiently:

```python
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def process_text(text):
    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4.1-mini",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": text}],
            temperature=0.7,
            max_tokens=150
        )
        return {
            "input": text,
            "output": response.choices[0].message.content
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "input": text,
            "error": str(e)
        }

# Batch process with rate limiting
def batch_process(texts, max_workers=5, requests_per_minute=50):
    results = []
    delay = 60 / requests_per_minute
    
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
        futures = []
        
        for text in texts:
            # Submit the task
            future = executor.submit(process_text, text)
            futures.append(future)
            
            # Rate limiting
            time.sleep(delay)
        
        # Collect results
        for future in futures:
            results.append(future.result())
    
    return results

# Example usage
texts = [
    "Summarize the benefits of renewable energy.",
    "Write a short story about a robot learning to paint.",
    "Explain quantum computing in simple terms.",
    # Add more texts...
]

results = batch_process(texts)
```

2. **Use System Instructions**: Set the tone and rules for the assistant's responses.
3. **Few-Shot Examples**: Include examples of desired input/output in your prompt.
4. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Split complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

#### **Example of Effective System Instructions**

```python
system_message = """
You are an expert Python programmer who helps write clean, efficient code.
When responding to coding questions:
1. First analyze the requirements carefully
2. Suggest a solution with well-structured, PEP 8 compliant code
3. Add comments explaining complex logic
4. Point out any edge cases or potential issues
5. Suggest unit tests for critical functions

Always prioritize readability and maintainability over clever optimizations.
"""

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a function to find the longest palindromic substring in a string."}
    ]
)
```

### **Performance Optimization Tips**

1. **Model Selection**: Use the smallest model that meets your needs.
2. **Token Management**: Keep prompts concise and control output length.
3. **Caching**: Cache responses for common queries.
4. **Batching**: Process multiple requests together when possible.
5. **Request Throttling**: Implement rate limiting to avoid API limits.
