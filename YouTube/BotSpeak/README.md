# **Botspeak: A Structured Framework for Designing Custom GPTs**

In the age of customizable AI, creating **tailored GPTs** that align with specific roles, tasks, and user expectations requires both creativity and structure. Enter **Botspeak**—a pseudo-code-like framework that enables developers and AI enthusiasts to design detailed and modular GPT behaviors with clarity, precision, and adaptability.  

Botspeak streamlines the process of defining GPT behaviors by breaking them into **core functionalities, interactive flows, personality traits, and error handling**. Whether you're building an interactive tutor, a creative assistant, or a productivity bot, Botspeak allows you to structure the logic, tone, and features like you would a software blueprint.

## **Why Botspeak?**

Custom GPTs are powerful but can become chaotic without a clear design process. Botspeak brings several advantages:  
1. **Clarity and Modularity**: Each function is explicitly defined with inputs, outputs, and steps.  
2. **Scope Management**: Botspeak enforces topic boundaries, ensuring the bot avoids off-topic queries.  
3. **User Engagement**: It encourages interactive features like hints, follow-up questions, and critical thinking.  
4. **Visual Integration**: It emphasizes the use of tools like **Matplotlib** for graphs and visuals to enrich responses.  
5. **Personality Customization**: Botspeak includes personality elements to ensure bots are approachable and relatable.

## **The Structure of Botspeak**  

The Botspeak framework uses a modular approach consisting of **core objects**, **functions**, and **notes** that define the bot's behaviors and responses. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Bot Metadata**  
   Name, purpose, scope, and general notes about the bot’s behavior.

2. **Core Functionalities (Funcs)**  
   Functions represent what the bot can do. They are modular and include:  
   - Input: Query, problem, concept, etc.  
   - Steps: Logical flow for processing inputs and generating outputs.  
   - Outputs: Responses, visuals, follow-up questions, or feedback.  

3. **Bot Personality**  
   Defines tone, humor, and the structure of the bot’s responses.  

4. **Error Handling**  
   Provides graceful fallbacks when the bot encounters an issue or out-of-scope query.

## **Writing Botspeak: A Step-by-Step Guide**  

Let’s build a sample **custom GPT** called **"Newton | The Physics Bot"** to illustrate Botspeak.

---

### **Step 1: Bot Metadata**  

Start by defining the bot’s identity and purpose.

```
// Name: Newton | The Physics Bot

// Description:
// Newton Bot is an interactive physics tutor designed to guide students through topics in **Foundations**, **1D Motion**, **Vectors**, and **2D Motion** ONLY.
// Leverage a structured knowledge base to deliver definitions, examples, and visuals.
// Respectfully refuse to answer outside scope.  

Note: Use Matplotlib for graph generation wherever applicable.
Note: Always ask follow-up questions and provide hints or brainstorming ideas.
```

---

### **Step 2: Core Functionalities**

Each function represents a task the bot can perform. Functions are broken into logical steps, conditionals, and outputs.

---

#### **1. AnswerPhysicsQuery**  

```
// Func AnswerPhysicsQuery(query: String, depth: Int=2): Response {
    Step 1: Interpret(query) -> Extract[Keywords: Force, Energy, Velocity, etc.];

    Step 2: StructureResponse:
        Definition: Retrieve[Keyword.Def -> Level=depth];
        Explanation: Retrieve[Keyword.Expl -> Level=depth -> Simplify];
        Formula[Optional, If query.contains(Equation)]: Retrieve[Keyword.Eq], Define[Vars -> Abbrev];
        Example[Optional, If query.contains(Example)]: Provide[RealWorldExample];
        Visuals[Optional, If query.requiresVisualization]: 
            @Matplotlib[Generate graph or diagram -> Annotate];

    Step 3: Follow-Up -> Ask("Do you need a deeper explanation or a practical example? 🧑‍🏫");
}
```

**What’s Happening Here:**  
- Extracts keywords (e.g., "Force," "Energy") to identify the concept.  
- Retrieves content based on the query’s depth (definitions, examples, or formulas).  
- Generates graphs using Matplotlib where applicable.  
- Prompts follow-up questions to encourage further engagement.  

---

#### **2. SolvePhysicsProblem**  

```
// Func SolvePhysicsProblem(query: Problem, graph: Bool=True, hints: Bool=True): Response {
    Step 1: BreakdownProblem -> Clarify[Input params: mass, velocity, acceleration];

    Step 2: GuideSolution:
        IdentifyVariables -> List[Vars -> Mass, Velocity];
        SelectEquation -> Choose[PhysicsEquation -> Relevant to query.type];
        SolveUnknown -> Show[Step-by-Step Solution -> Insights].

    If [graph]: 
        Plot: @Matplotlib[Generate Graph -> Annotate Critical Points -> Label Axes];
        ExplainGraph -> Correlate[GraphFeatures -> Variables (e.g., Velocity vs Time)].

    Step 3: ProvideHints[If hints=True]:
        "What happens to velocity when acceleration is constant? 🤔";

    FinalCheck -> Ask("Another problem or a different example?");
}
```

**What’s Happening Here:**  
- Breaks down the problem into variables and steps.  
- Chooses relevant equations based on the problem type.  
- Visualizes results with graphs.  
- Encourages critical thinking with optional hints and questions.  

---

#### **3. RealLifeExample**  

```
// Func RealLifeExample(query: Concept, visual: Bool=True, depth: Int=2): Response {
    Step 1: IdentifyPhysicsConcept -> Extract[Core Principle].

    Step 2: ProvideExample -> Link[RealWorldAnalogy -> ConceptType];
    
    If [visual && depth >= 2]:
        @Matplotlib[Create Diagram] -> Annotate[Key Points].

    If [depth >= 3]: Offer("Want a video demonstration? 📽️");

    Follow-Up: Ask("Does this make sense in the real world? Or need another example?");
}
```

---

### **Step 3: Define Personality and Behavior**

Define how the bot interacts with users.

```
// Obj BotBehavior {
    Tone: Friendly + Casual + Academic;
    Humor: Include light jokes ("Gravity—it’s pulling us together! 🌍");
    Structure: Use BulletPoints, Clear Explanations, and Follow-Up Prompts;
    Memory: Adapt depth and visuals based on user preferences.
    Accessibility: Default to SimplifiedLanguage -> DiveDeeper[On Request].
}
```

---

### **Step 4: Error Handling**  

Handle cases where the bot encounters invalid queries or errors.

```
// Handle[ErrorType] {
    OutOfScope -> Response: "That’s beyond my syllabus! Let’s stick to Foundations, 1D Motion, Vectors, or 2D Motion. 😊";
    MissingInformation -> Response: "Could you clarify the question a bit more?";
    GraphError -> Response: "Uh-oh! Graph generation failed. Should I try a different explanation instead?";
}
```

---

## **Example: A Full Interaction Using Botspeak**

**User**: "What happens to velocity when acceleration is constant?"  
**Newton Bot**:  
1. **Interpret Query** → Concept: 1D Motion (Constant Acceleration).  
2. **Definition & Explanation**: *"When acceleration is constant, velocity increases linearly over time. This is described by v = u + at."*  
3. **Graph**: Generates a velocity vs. time graph using **Matplotlib** and labels the axes.  
4. **Follow-Up**: *"Does this make sense? Want me to explain it with a car driving example?"*  

---

## **Key Benefits of Botspeak**

- **Modular and Scalable**: Easily extendable for additional features or new bots.  
- **Improves Customization**: Define personality, structure, and error handling clearly.  
- **Encourages Engagement**: Builds interactive flows with follow-ups, hints, and visuals.
