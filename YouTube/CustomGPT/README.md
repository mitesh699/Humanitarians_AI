Structured Esample

### **Documentation: Writing a Custom GPT like Newton | The Physics Bot**

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to designing and developing a custom GPT-powered assistant, similar to Newton | The Physics Bot. It includes detailed explanations, examples, and best practices for creating a specialized, interactive, and user-friendly AI system.

---

### **1. Define the Bot's Purpose and Scope**
The first step is to clearly define the bot's purpose and the scope of its functionality. This ensures that the bot remains focused and delivers high-quality responses within its domain.

#### **Example**:
- **Name**: Newton | The Physics Bot
- **Purpose**: To serve as an interactive physics tutor for students.
- **Scope**:
  - Topics covered: Foundations, 1D Motion, Vectors, 2D Motion.
  - Topics outside the scope: Electromagnetism, Quantum Mechanics, etc.

#### **Implementation**:
Create a short description highlighting the bot's purpose:
```
// Description:
Newton Bot is an interactive physics tutor that guides students through topics in Foundations, 1D Motion, Vectors, and 2D Motion ONLY. It delivers structured answers with examples, visual aids, and real-world analogies. Questions outside this scope will prompt a respectful reminder to "stick to the syllabus."
```

---

### **2. Plan the Bot's Features**
Identify the key functionalities of the bot. These should align with the bot's purpose and user needs.

#### **Example Features**:
1. **Q&A System**: Provide answers with definitions, explanations, examples, and visuals.
2. **Problem Solving**: Offer step-by-step guidance for solving physics problems.
3. **Critical Thinking Support**: Engage users with reflective questions and hints.
4. **Real-World Examples**: Link physics concepts to practical scenarios.
5. **Exam Preparation**: Provide quizzes, mock tests, and review tips.

---

### **3. Define Core Functions**
Break down the features into core functions, each with a clear purpose, inputs, and outputs. Use pseudo-code to outline their behavior.

#### **Example Function: AnswerPhysicsQuery**
```python
# Function to Answer Physics Queries
Func AnswerPhysicsQuery(query: String, depth: Int=2): Response {
    Step 1: Interpret(query) -> Extract[Keywords -> Force, Motion, etc.];
    Step 2: StructureResponse -> Provide[
        Definition, Explanation, Formula, Example, Visual
    ]:
        - Definition: Retrieve[Keyword.Def -> Level=depth];
        - Explanation: Retrieve[Keyword.Expl -> Level=depth -> Simplify];
        - Formula: Optional[If query.contains(Equation)];
        - Example: Optional[If query.contains(Example)];
        - Visuals: Optional[If query.requiresVisualization] -> @Matplotlib;
    Step 3: Follow-up -> Ask("Need more depth or another example?");
}
```

---

### **4. Design a Personality**
The bot's personality is crucial for user engagement. Define its tone, behavior, and adaptability.

#### **Example**:
```
// Personality:
- Friendly, witty, and approachable.
- Encourages curiosity and learning.
- Uses humor: "Gravity‚Äîit‚Äôs pulling us together! üåç"
- Simplifies explanations but adapts to advanced queries.
```

---

### **5. Implement Error Handling**
Define fallback responses for unsupported queries or unexpected errors.

#### **Example**:
```python
# Error Handling
Handle[ErrorType] {
    If[UnsupportedQuery]:
        Response -> "This topic is outside my scope. Let's focus on physics foundations!"
    If[GraphError]:
        Response -> "Oops! Graph creation failed. Should I try a different format?"
}
```

---

### **6. Integrate Visuals**
Enhance explanations with visuals using libraries like Matplotlib. Automate graph generation for applicable queries.

#### **Example: Generating a Velocity-Time Graph**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_velocity_time(velocity, time):
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
    plt.plot(time, velocity, label='Velocity-Time Graph', marker='o')
    plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
    plt.ylabel('Velocity (m/s)')
    plt.title('Velocity vs. Time')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid()
    plt.annotate('Start Point', (time[0], velocity[0]))
    plt.show()
```

When a user asks a question about motion, the bot can call this function:
```python
query = "Show me a velocity vs. time graph for constant acceleration."
plot_velocity_time([0, 5, 10, 15], [0, 1, 2, 3])
```

---

### **7. Develop Interactive Features**
Add prompts for follow-up questions, feedback, and brainstorming. This keeps the user engaged.

#### **Example**:
```python
# Follow-up Prompt
Response -> "Would you like another example, or shall we explore a different concept? üòä"
```

---

### **8. Build Exam Preparation Tools**
Provide quizzes and review materials to help users prepare for exams.

#### **Example Quiz Function**:
```python
def generate_quiz(topic):
    if topic == "1D Motion":
        return [
            {"question": "What is the formula for acceleration?", "options": ["a = Œîv / Œît", "F = ma"], "answer": "a = Œîv / Œît"},
            {"question": "What is the SI unit of velocity?", "options": ["m/s", "kg"], "answer": "m/s"}
        ]

quiz = generate_quiz("1D Motion")
for q in quiz:
    print(q["question"])
```

---

### **9. Use Real-World Examples**
Relate physics concepts to practical applications for better understanding.

#### **Example**:
```python
query = "How does projectile motion work in sports?"
Response -> "Projectile motion is observed when you throw a basketball. The parabolic path it follows is due to the initial velocity and gravitational acceleration. Here's a graph of its trajectory!"
@Matplotlib -> PlotTrajectory[InitialVelocity, Angle, Gravity]
```

---

### **10. Combine All Features into an Object-Oriented Design**
Organize the bot's features into a modular structure for maintainability and scalability.

#### **Example Object Definition: NewtonBot**
```python
class NewtonBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.personality = "Friendly, witty, academic"
    
    def answer_query(self, query, depth=2):
        # Interpret and structure the response
        pass
    
    def solve_problem(self, problem, graph=True):
        # Step-by-step problem-solving with graph generation
        pass
    
    def generate_quiz(self, topic):
        # Create a topic-specific quiz
        pass

    def plot_graph(self, data, graph_type):
        # Generate a graph using Matplotlib
        pass
```

---

### **11. Test and Iterate**
- Test the bot with sample queries:
  - "What is the formula for acceleration?"
  - "Plot a graph for constant velocity."
- Collect feedback to improve its responses and features.

---

### **Example Interaction**
**User**: "What is Newton's second law of motion?"  
**NewtonBot**:  
- "Newton's second law states that F = ma, where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. Here's a graph to visualize this relationship for varying masses."  
*(Graph displayed)*  
- "Would you like to explore a real-world example or solve a related problem?"

---

### **Best Practices**
1. **Start Small**: Focus on a limited domain initially.
2. **Use Modular Design**: Break features into reusable components.
3. **Leverage Visuals**: Use graphs and diagrams wherever applicable.
4. **Engage Users**: Ask questions, provide hints, and offer feedback.
5. **Iterate**: Continuously improve based on user feedback.

By following these steps, you can create a specialized, interactive GPT-powered assistant like Newton | The Physics Bot.
