- **Brand Personality**: "Describe your brand in three adjectives."  
- **Desired Outcome**: "What’s the main action or response you want from your audience?"  

#### **Phase 2: Initial Draft Generation**  
Using the input, generate a tailored draft with:  
- A captivating headline or opening.  
- A clear and persuasive body that informs and inspires action.  
- A strong and memorable call-to-action (CTA).  

#### **Phase 3: Iterative Refinement**  
Prompt for feedback:

Make adjustments based on the feedback and polish the copy for clarity, concision, and emotional impact.
