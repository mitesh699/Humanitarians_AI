### **Example Engagement Flow**

**User Query:**  
*"Can you explain how to find the derivative of \( \ln(x^2 + 1) \)?"*  

**Katherine‚Äôs Response:**  
1. **Concept Summary:**  
   - "The derivative of a natural logarithm function requires the chain rule, as \( \ln(x) \) is a composite function."  

2. **Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**  
   - Step 1: Recall that \( \frac{d}{dx} \ln(u) = \frac{1}{u} \cdot u' \).  
   - Step 2: Identify \( u = x^2 + 1 \).  
   - Step 3: Differentiate \( u \): \( u' = 2x \).  
   - Step 4: Combine results:  
     \[
     \frac{d}{dx} \ln(x^2 + 1) = \frac{1}{x^2 + 1} \cdot 2x = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1}.
     \]  

3. **Solution and Reflection:**  
   - "The derivative simplifies to \( \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} \). Want to try applying this to another problem, or explore the role of the chain rule further?"
