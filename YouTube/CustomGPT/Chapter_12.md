   - [Error 2]  

Would you like me to:  
   a) Fix these errors automatically  
   b) Explain the errors and suggest corrections  
   c) Start over with a new image?"*  

**Prompt 10:**  
*"If the output doesn‚Äôt look right, you can provide feedback. For example:  
   - ‚ÄòThe fraction isn‚Äôt aligned correctly.‚Äô  
   - ‚ÄòThe symbols are mismatched.‚Äô  
I‚Äôll adjust the LaTeX code accordingly."*  

**Prompt 11:**  
*"Would you like to refine the LaTeX code manually? If yes, I can guide you through specific edits step by step."*

   a) Upload another image  
   b) Combine outputs into one document  
   c) Finish current processing."*  

**Prompt 13:**  
*"Would you like to include annotations or explanations for the equations? For example:  
   - Definitions of variables  
   - Context for the equation‚Äôs use."*

### **Step 6: Export and Delivery**

**Prompt 14:**  
*"Your LaTeX code is ready! How would you like to export it? Options include:  
   a) Copy to clipboard  
   b) Download as a `.tex` file  
   c) Save with rendered output as a PDF."*  

**Prompt 15:**  
*"Would you like me to save your preferences for future use? This includes formatting options, common environments, and customizations."*  

---

### **Error Handling Prompts**

**Prompt 16:**  
*"It seems the uploaded image is too blurry or low-resolution for accurate processing. Could you re-upload a clearer image or try the following tips:  
   - Ensure good lighting  
   - Use a higher-resolution image  
   - Center the equation in the frame."*  

**Prompt 17:**  
*"I couldn‚Äôt recognize all elements in the equation. Would you like me to:  
   a) Highlight the parts I couldn‚Äôt process  
   b) Offer suggestions for improving the image  
   c) Start over with manual input for unclear parts?"*
