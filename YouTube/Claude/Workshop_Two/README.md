# The Art of Prompt Engineering: Speaking to Computers Through Natural Language

## Introduction to Language Models

Large Language Models function by recognizing patterns in language. These systems learn how words typically fit together by analyzing vast amounts of text data from books, articles, and conversations. They don't truly understand meaning as humans do, but they recognize patterns so well they can predict which words should follow others, creating coherent text that appears meaningful.

## From Code to Conversation: A New Paradigm

Unlike traditional programming languages that require absolute precision with every symbol and command, prompt engineering offers a revolutionary approach to human-computer interaction. 

**Traditional programming** is like building a machine where every component has a specific purpose and must fit perfectly with its neighbors. The program only performs the exact tasks it was designed for, following strict instructions with no room for interpretation.

**Prompt engineering**, by contrast, uses natural language—the words we use in everyday conversation—to guide AI systems. Rather than defining every possible action through rigid syntax, we describe what we want in plain language, and the model interprets and responds accordingly.

It's the difference between constructing a detailed blueprint that specifies every element of a structure versus describing the building you want to see and having it materialize based on your description.

## The Craft of Clear Communication

Just as with human writing, there is good and bad prompting. Clear, precise language helps language models understand exactly what you're asking for. Vague, ambiguous instructions lead to unpredictable or unhelpful responses.

When crafting prompts, think of yourself as a writer communicating with a reader who is incredibly literal yet remarkably flexible. This reader has vast knowledge but needs clear guidance to apply it effectively. The more specific and well-structured your request, the better the response will be.

## The Power of Examples

One of the most effective techniques in prompt engineering is using examples. Showing the model what you want rather than just telling it dramatically improves results. Examples provide concrete patterns for the model to follow, reducing ambiguity and increasing precision.

For instance, instead of simply asking for "a professional email," you might provide a partial example that demonstrates the tone and structure you're seeking. The model can then pattern-match based on your example to generate similar content.

## Prompt Patterns: The Writer's Toolkit for AI Communication

Just as writers develop specific techniques to communicate effectively with readers, prompt engineers employ proven patterns to communicate with language models. These patterns serve as reliable approaches for achieving particular outcomes—each with its own strengths and appropriate use cases.

### Basic Prompt Patterns

#### The Persona Pattern: Finding the Right Voice

Great writers know the power of voice and perspective. Ernest Hemingway's terse, direct style in "The Old Man and the Sea" creates immediacy, while Virginia Woolf's stream-of-consciousness in "Mrs. Dalloway" reveals inner worlds through perspective shifts. When we adopt the Persona Pattern in prompt engineering, we're essentially defining the voice and perspective the language model should use.

**How it works:** You instruct the model to adopt a specific role, perspective, or set of characteristics when responding.

**Example with Jane Austen:** Just as Austen adopted a voice of wry social observation, you might prompt:

"Speaking as a thoughtful social observer with Jane Austen's attention to subtle human dynamics, analyze the interpersonal politics of this workplace scenario..."

The model will then adopt characteristics associated with Austen's perspective—attentiveness to social nuance, subtle irony, and moral insight—rather than approaching the question clinically or abstractly.

**Why it works:** By providing a well-defined persona, you give the model specific constraints and characteristics to emulate, resulting in more consistent, targeted responses.

#### The Template Pattern: Architectural Structure for Thoughts

James Joyce's "Ulysses" follows a precise structure modeled after Homer's "Odyssey," with each chapter employing different literary techniques to achieve specific effects. Similarly, the Template Pattern provides a framework that organizes the model's response.

**How it works:** You outline a specific structure for the model to follow in its response, with clear sections, ordering, or formatting.

**Example with Charles Dickens:** Just as Dickens structured "A Tale of Two Cities" with parallel narratives that eventually converge, you might prompt:

"Please analyze this business problem using the following structure:
1. First, summarize the current situation in clear, concrete terms
2. Then, examine two contrasting approaches to solving it
3. Next, identify potential consequences of each approach
4. Finally, recommend a path forward with specific action steps"

**Why it works:** Templates reduce ambiguity about what information to include and how to organize it, resulting in more focused, useful responses.

[![Video: Bear Brown's Prompt Tips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikbearbrown/ENGR-0201-Organizing-Academic-Success-AI-for-Personalized-Learning/refs/heads/main/Claude/Workshop_Two/Artwork/vezffqfcbyj.png)](https://youtu.be/NLg2kpBOG7w?si=vL6Jueas05a14g1Z)


#### The Flipped Interaction Pattern: Socratic Dialogue

This approach mirrors the Socratic method employed by philosophers throughout history. Instead of making direct statements, it uses questions to guide thinking. Plato's dialogues showcase Socrates using questions to help others reach conclusions themselves.

**How it works:** Rather than asking for direct answers, you instruct the model to ask exploratory questions that guide your thinking.

**Example with James Baldwin:** Just as Baldwin's essays often pose searching questions that probe beneath comfortable assumptions, you might prompt:

"In the style of James Baldwin's penetrating inquiry, please ask me a series of increasingly deeper questions about my project's ethical implications, helping me examine assumptions I might be overlooking."

**Why it works:** This pattern helps uncover hidden assumptions and explore topics more thoughtfully, as the model guides exploration rather than simply providing answers.

#### The Recipe Pattern: Step-by-Step Clarity

Edgar Allan Poe described his method for writing "The Raven" in "The Philosophy of Composition," breaking down his creative process into clear, sequential steps. The Recipe Pattern applies this same methodical approach to prompt engineering.

**How it works:** You request information in a clearly sequenced, step-by-step format with explicit ordering.

**Example with Julia Child:** Just as Child's precise cooking instructions in "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" made complex techniques accessible, you might prompt:

"Please provide step-by-step instructions for conducting a content audit, with the careful attention to process and detail that Julia Child brings to her cooking techniques. Include preparatory steps, main actions, and verification methods."

**Why it works:** Breaking complex processes into discrete, ordered steps creates clarity and ensures nothing important is overlooked.

### Advanced Prompt Patterns

As you become more proficient with basic prompt patterns, you can explore more sophisticated techniques that address complex communication challenges. These advanced patterns offer additional tools for your prompt engineering toolkit.

#### The Game Play Pattern: Engaging Through Structured Play

Game designers, like writers, create structured experiences with rules, objectives, and rewards. Jane McGonigal's work on game psychology reveals how game structures can motivate thinking and problem-solving in engaging ways. The Game Play Pattern applies these principles to AI interaction.

**How it works:** You frame the interaction as a game with defined rules, objectives, and reward structures, encouraging creative or analytical thinking within an engaging framework.

**Example with Lewis Carroll:** Just as Carroll created the logical puzzles and wordplay in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," you might prompt:

"Let's play a game of 'Conceptual Connections.' I'll give you two seemingly unrelated concepts (e.g., 'quantum physics' and 'social media'), and you'll create four increasingly insightful connections between them, scoring points for creativity and depth. For each connection, explain why it's valid and how it helps us understand both concepts better. Ready to play?"

**Why it works:** Game structures tap into intrinsic motivation, making complex analytical tasks more engaging while providing clear parameters for the AI's response.

[![Video: Bear Brown's Prompt Tips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikbearbrown/ENGR-0201-Organizing-Academic-Success-AI-for-Personalized-Learning/refs/heads/main/Claude/Workshop_Two/Artwork/avayqzocgkm.png)](https://youtu.be/NLg2kpBOG7w?si=vL6Jueas05a14g1Z)


#### The Meta Language Creation Pattern: Specialized Communication Systems

Authors like Anthony Burgess in "A Clockwork Orange" or George Orwell in "1984" created specialized vocabularies to achieve specific effects. Similarly, the Meta Language Creation Pattern involves developing a specialized shorthand or notation system for efficient communication about complex topics.

**How it works:** You establish a tailored vocabulary, notation, or communication system for a specific domain or purpose.

**Example with J.R.R. Tolkien:** Just as Tolkien created languages for his Middle-earth with specific rules and structures, you might prompt:

"Let's create a specialized notation system for discussing emotional intelligence in leadership. Using symbols and abbreviated terms, design a concise way to represent concepts like 'empathetic listening' (EL), 'self-regulation' (SR→), and 'social awareness' (SA∞). Then use this notation to analyze this leadership scenario, providing both the notation and expanded explanation."

**Why it works:** Specialized language systems reduce complexity and increase precision when discussing nuanced or technical topics, allowing for more efficient communication.

#### The Alternative Approaches Pattern: Multiple Perspectives for Insight

Writers like Rashomon's Akutagawa or Virginia Woolf often present multiple perspectives on the same events. Similarly, the Alternative Approaches Pattern invites consideration of various solutions or viewpoints.

**How it works:** You explicitly request multiple different approaches or perspectives on a problem or topic.

**Example with F. Scott Fitzgerald:** Just as Fitzgerald noted that "the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function," you might prompt:

"Channel F. Scott Fitzgerald's ability to hold contradictory ideas simultaneously, and provide three fundamentally different approaches to addressing climate change: one market-based, one regulatory, and one cultural/behavioral. For each approach, explore its unique strengths, limitations, and underlying assumptions without immediately judging which is best."

**Why it works:** Examining multiple approaches prevents fixation on a single solution path and reveals insights that might be missed from a more limited perspective.

[![Video: Bear Brown's Prompt Tips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikbearbrown/ENGR-0201-Organizing-Academic-Success-AI-for-Personalized-Learning/refs/heads/main/Claude/Workshop_Two/Artwork/qwzrvaauqlh.png)](https://youtu.be/NLg2kpBOG7w?si=vL6Jueas05a14g1Z)


#### The Ask for Input Pattern: Collaborative Problem-Solving

Writers like Neil Gaiman are known for their collaborative approach, actively seeking input from readers and other writers. The Ask for Input Pattern applies this collaborative mindset to AI interactions.

**How it works:** You explicitly invite the AI to request specific information from you that would help it provide better assistance, creating a more dynamic exchange.

**Example with Toni Morrison:** Just as Morrison's writing process involved deep listening and gathering stories, you might prompt:

"I need help developing a diversity and inclusion training program. Using Toni Morrison's approach of deep listening before speaking, please ask me 3-5 specific questions about our organization, current challenges, and goals that would help you provide more targeted recommendations. Wait for my answers before developing the program outline."

**Why it works:** This pattern acknowledges information gaps and creates a collaborative exchange that produces more relevant and targeted outcomes.

#### The Outline Expansion Pattern: From Structure to Substance

Writers often begin with outlines before developing full manuscripts. E.L. Doctorow famously said that "writing is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way." The Outline Expansion Pattern applies this progressive development approach.

**How it works:** You provide or request a high-level structure, then systematically expand each element with increasing detail.

**Example with John McPhee:** Just as McPhee is known for his meticulous structural planning followed by detailed expansion, you might prompt:

"Following John McPhee's layered writing approach, please:
1. First, create a 5-point outline for an essay about sustainable architecture
2. Then, expand each outline point with 3 supporting sub-points
3. Next, develop the first two outline points into full paragraphs with examples
4. Finally, suggest research sources that would strengthen each section"

**Why it works:** Starting with structure before details ensures coherent organization while allowing for systematic development of complex ideas.

#### The Fact Check List Pattern: Ensuring Accuracy and Nuance

Journalists and non-fiction writers like Katherine Boo or Michael Lewis are meticulous about factual accuracy while acknowledging areas of uncertainty. The Fact Check List Pattern brings this journalistic rigor to AI interactions.

**How it works:** You create a framework that explicitly distinguishes between verified facts, uncertainties, and falsehoods on a topic.

**Example with Joan Didion:** Just as Didion was known for her unflinching commitment to precision and truth, you might prompt:

"With Joan Didion's commitment to factual precision, please analyze the current discourse around quantum computing by creating three clearly labeled sections:
1. VERIFIED FACTS: Information with strong scientific consensus and experimental validation
2. ACTIVE RESEARCH AREAS: Promising directions with ongoing work but incomplete evidence
3. MISCONCEPTIONS: Common claims that are demonstrably incorrect or highly misleading

For each section, cite specific examples and explain your categorization reasoning."

**Why it works:** This pattern creates clarity about the reliability of different information, preventing the conflation of established facts with speculation or errors.

## Prompting for Claude: Working with a Hybrid Reasoning Model

### Understanding Claude's Hybrid Reasoning Approach

Claude operates on what we might call a "hybrid reasoning model" – combining neural network pattern recognition with more structured reasoning capabilities. Think of it as similar to how David Foster Wallace could blend analytical precision with emotional intuition, or how Jorge Luis Borges wove together logical puzzles with imaginative storytelling. This hybrid approach allows Claude to both recognize broad patterns in language and engage in step-by-step logical reasoning.

In literary terms, Claude is like a writer who can both craft lyrical prose spontaneously and construct meticulously reasoned arguments – capable of both "showing" through rich examples and "telling" through clear explanation. Understanding this dual nature allows us to craft prompts that leverage these complementary strengths.

### Prompting Techniques for Claude's Reasoning Capabilities

#### The Explicit Reasoning Pattern: Making Thinking Visible

Nobel Prize-winning author Daniel Kahneman distinguishes between "System 1" (fast, intuitive) and "System 2" (slow, deliberative) thinking. With Claude, you can activate more deliberative reasoning by requesting explicit thinking steps.

**How it works:** You ask Claude to "think step by step" or to show its reasoning process before reaching conclusions.

**Example with George Eliot:** Just as Eliot carefully traced the moral reasoning of her characters in "Middlemarch," revealing their thought processes to readers, you might prompt:

"Before answering whether this business strategy will succeed, please think step by step through the relevant factors, considering market conditions, competitive landscape, resource requirements, and potential obstacles. Like George Eliot's careful moral reasoning, walk through each consideration explicitly before reaching your conclusion."

**Why it works:** Requesting explicit reasoning steps helps Claude organize its analysis more systematically and reduces the likelihood of overlooking important factors.

[![Video: Bear Brown's Prompt Tips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikbearbrown/ENGR-0201-Organizing-Academic-Success-AI-for-Personalized-Learning/refs/heads/main/Claude/Workshop_Two/Artwork/bpyrxbinpzk.png)](https://youtu.be/NLg2kpBOG7w?si=vL6Jueas05a14g1Z)


#### The Balanced Analysis Pattern: Engaging Multiple Reasoning Modes

Renaissance writers like Montaigne combined personal observation with scholarly analysis, creating works that balanced subjective and objective perspectives. Similarly, Claude can blend intuitive pattern recognition with systematic reasoning.

**How it works:** You explicitly request both intuitive pattern recognition and systematic analysis in your prompt.

**Example with W.E.B. Du Bois:** Just as Du Bois masterfully combined sociological data with personal narrative in "The Souls of Black Folk," you might prompt:

"Analyze this educational policy proposal in two complementary ways:
1. First, provide your intuitive assessment based on pattern recognition from similar policies.
2. Then, systematically evaluate it using a clear framework that considers equity impacts, implementation challenges, cost-effectiveness, and evidence basis.
Conclude by explaining how these two approaches complement or challenge each other."

**Why it works:** This pattern leverages both aspects of Claude's reasoning capabilities, resulting in more comprehensive analysis.

#### The Chain-of-Thought Extension Pattern: Building Complex Reasoning

Science fiction author Ted Chiang is known for carefully exploring the logical implications of speculative premises, following chains of consequences to their natural conclusions. Similarly, Claude can extend reasoning chains when properly prompted.

**How it works:** You provide an initial reasoning chain and ask Claude to extend it further, exploring additional implications or dimensions.

**Example with Ted Chiang:** Just as Chiang meticulously traces the implications of his speculative premises in stories like "Story of Your Life," you might prompt:

"I've started analyzing how quantum computing might affect cybersecurity:
1. Quantum computers could eventually break current encryption standards.
2. This would compromise secure communications across the internet.
3. New quantum-resistant encryption methods would become necessary.

Please continue this chain of reasoning for 5 more steps, exploring the deeper technical, economic, and social implications that might follow. For each step, explain both the direct consequence and any feedback loops or secondary effects."

**Why it works:** This pattern encourages Claude to follow logical connections more extensively, resulting in deeper analysis of complex topics.

[![Video: Bear Brown's Prompt Tips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikbearbrown/ENGR-0201-Organizing-Academic-Success-AI-for-Personalized-Learning/refs/heads/main/Claude/Workshop_Two/Artwork/fveeebzhjfx.png)](https://youtu.be/NLg2kpBOG7w?si=vL6Jueas05a14g1Z)


#### The Cognitive Tool Selection Pattern: Choosing the Right Thinking Approach

Zadie Smith has discussed how she deliberately chooses different narrative techniques based on what each story needs. Similarly, we can prompt Claude to select and apply the most appropriate cognitive tools for different problems.

**How it works:** You explicitly frame the problem type and suggest appropriate reasoning approaches for that category of problem.

**Example with Zadie Smith:** Just as Smith adapts her writing approach to serve each story's unique needs, you might prompt:

"This is a complex ethical dilemma involving medical resource allocation. Please approach it like Zadie Smith adapts her narrative techniques to different stories:
1. First, identify what type of problem this is and what cognitive tools would be most appropriate (e.g., utilitarian calculation, rights-based reasoning, virtue ethics, etc.).
2. Then, apply those specific tools to analyze the situation.
3. Finally, reflect on the limitations of your chosen approach and how alternative methods might yield different insights."

**Why it works:** This pattern helps Claude match its reasoning approach to the specific demands of the problem, improving the quality and relevance of its analysis.

#### The Reflection and Refinement Pattern: Iterative Improvement

Great editors like Maxwell Perkins (who worked with Hemingway and Fitzgerald) helped writers refine their work through thoughtful feedback and revision. Similarly, Claude can be prompted to review and improve its own reasoning.

**How it works:** You ask Claude to generate an initial response, then critically evaluate and refine that response.

**Example with Virginia Woolf:** Just as Woolf meticulously revised her work (evident in her heavily annotated manuscripts), you might prompt:

"Please analyze this research proposal in two phases:
1. First, provide your initial assessment of its strengths and weaknesses.
2. Then, channel Virginia Woolf's rigorous self-editing process to critically review your own analysis: What biases might have influenced your initial assessment? What important aspects did you overlook? What nuances should be added? How could your feedback be more constructive?
3. Finally, provide a revised, more refined evaluation based on this reflection."

**Why it works:** This pattern mimics the critical reflection process of careful writing and editing, leading to more nuanced and balanced outputs.

### Practical Tips for Working with Claude's Hybrid Reasoning

1. **Be explicit about reasoning requirements**: Clearly state when you want step-by-step thinking versus intuitive pattern matching.

2. **Use appropriate framing**: Signal whether a task requires creative generation, analytical reasoning, or both.

3. **Provide scaffolding for complex reasoning**: For difficult problems, break them down into intermediate steps or provide partial reasoning for Claude to continue.

4. **Request multiple passes**: For important analyses, ask Claude to review its own work and identify potential improvements or gaps.

5. **Leverage comparative analysis**: Claude often reasons most effectively when asked to compare and contrast different approaches or perspectives.

By understanding and leveraging Claude's hybrid reasoning capabilities, you can craft prompts that produce more thoughtful, nuanced, and comprehensive responses – much as a skilled editor brings out the best in a talented but complex writer.

## Exercises: Practicing Prompt Engineering Patterns

Just as writers hone their craft through deliberate practice, prompt engineers improve through hands-on application of different patterns. The following exercises will help you develop fluency with the 15 key prompt patterns, each serving a distinct purpose in your communication with language models.

### 1. Persona Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** The Persona Pattern instructs an AI to adopt a specific role, character, or perspective to enhance the relevance and specificity of responses.

**Example:** "As a marine biologist specializing in coral reef ecosystems, explain the impact of ocean acidification on biodiversity."

**Your Exercise:** Create a prompt using the Persona Pattern to help you understand a complex topic from your field of interest or study. Choose a specific expert persona (e.g., historian focusing on a particular era, scientist in a specialized field) that would provide unique insights into your chosen topic.

### 2. Audience Persona Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern tailors communication based on the knowledge level and characteristics of a specific audience, ensuring appropriate language and examples.

**Example:** "Explain quantum computing to a bright high school student with a strong interest in physics but limited mathematical background. Use relatable analogies and avoid complex equations."

**Your Exercise:** Take a concept you understand well and create a prompt that asks for an explanation tailored to a specific audience (e.g., elementary school students, industry professionals, seniors learning technology). Be specific about the audience's characteristics, knowledge level, and needs.

[![Video: Bear Brown's Prompt Tips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikbearbrown/ENGR-0201-Organizing-Academic-Success-AI-for-Personalized-Learning/refs/heads/main/Claude/Workshop_Two/Artwork/vwvfswppdot.png)](https://youtu.be/NLg2kpBOG7w?si=vL6Jueas05a14g1Z)


### 3. Flipped Interaction Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern reverses the traditional question-answer dynamic by having the AI ask questions that guide your thinking process, similar to Socratic teaching methods.

**Example:** "I'm trying to decide whether to transition my small business to a subscription model. Instead of giving me advice directly, please ask me a series of thoughtful questions that will help me think through the key considerations and potential impacts."

**Your Exercise:** Identify a decision or problem you're currently facing. Create a prompt that asks Claude to guide your thinking process by asking questions rather than providing direct answers. Specify the type of questions that would be most helpful (e.g., exploratory, challenging assumptions, practical considerations).

### 4. Game Play Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern structures the interaction as a game with defined rules, objectives, and rewards to make complex topics more engaging and interactive.

**Example:** "Let's play 'Concept Evolution.' Start with the basic concept of 'democracy' and evolve it through 5 rounds, each adding complexity and nuance. In each round, introduce one new aspect or perspective that transforms our understanding of the concept. Award points for historical accuracy, philosophical depth, and practical implications."

**Your Exercise:** Create a game-based prompt to explore a topic you want to learn more about. Define clear rules, scoring mechanisms, and win conditions. Consider how the game structure might reveal new insights or make learning more engaging.

[![Video: Bear Brown's Prompt Tips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikbearbrown/ENGR-0201-Organizing-Academic-Success-AI-for-Personalized-Learning/refs/heads/main/Claude/Workshop_Two/Artwork/rynfdjfbarc.png)](https://youtu.be/NLg2kpBOG7w?si=vL6Jueas05a14g1Z)


### 5. Template Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern provides a structured framework or format for the AI to follow, ensuring consistency and organization in complex responses.

**Example:** "Analyze the following policy proposal using this template:
- Summary: (2-3 sentence overview)
- Stakeholders: (list primary affected groups)
- Benefits: (3-5 points with brief explanations)
- Challenges: (3-5 points with brief explanations)
- Alternatives: (2-3 other approaches)
- Implementation Considerations: (key factors for successful execution)"

**Your Exercise:** Create a template for analyzing or presenting information in your field of interest. Design a structure that would make complex information more accessible and organized, then ask Claude to apply it to a specific topic or problem.

### 6. Meta Language Creation Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern develops specialized terminology, shorthand, or notation to communicate complex ideas more efficiently within a specific domain.

**Example:** "Let's create a shorthand notation for describing team dynamics, where:
T(h) = high-trust environment
C(l) = low collaboration
L(+) = positive leadership influence
D(-) = negative decision-making process
Using this notation, analyze the following case study of a project team, explaining both the shorthand assessment and its meaning."

**Your Exercise:** For a domain you're familiar with, create a prompt that asks Claude to develop and then use a specialized notation or terminology system. Specify what kinds of concepts need representation and how the shorthand might be used for analysis.

### 7. Recipe Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern requests step-by-step instructions with specific ordering, details, and contingencies, similar to a cooking recipe.

**Example:** "Provide a detailed 'recipe' for facilitating a productive team retrospective meeting, including:
- 'Ingredients' (necessary materials and preparations)
- 'Prep work' (actions before the meeting)
- Sequenced steps with timing
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Variations for different team sizes
- How to know when the 'dish' is successfully complete"

**Your Exercise:** Identify a process in your personal or professional life that would benefit from clear, sequential instructions. Create a prompt asking for a detailed recipe, specifying the level of detail needed and any particular challenges to address.

### 8. Alternative Approaches Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern requests multiple distinct methods or perspectives for addressing a challenge, encouraging creative thinking and comprehensive analysis.

**Example:** "Present four different approaches to reducing email overload in a corporate environment, each based on a different underlying philosophy: a technological solution, a behavioral/psychological approach, a policy/organizational structure solution, and a minimalist/essentialist perspective. Highlight the unique advantages and potential drawbacks of each approach."

**Your Exercise:** Select a problem or challenge you're facing and create a prompt that asks for multiple distinct approaches to solving it. Specify the types of approaches you'd like to see (e.g., based on different disciplines, philosophical frameworks, or resource requirements).


[![Video: Bear Brown's Prompt Tips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikbearbrown/ENGR-0201-Organizing-Academic-Success-AI-for-Personalized-Learning/refs/heads/main/Claude/Workshop_Two/Artwork/idcxebnouhr.png)](https://youtu.be/NLg2kpBOG7w?si=vL6Jueas05a14g1Z)



### 9. Ask for Input Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern creates a more interactive exchange by having the AI request specific information from you to tailor its response more effectively.

**Example:** "I want to improve my public speaking skills. Before providing recommendations, please ask me 3-5 specific questions about my current abilities, challenges, upcoming speaking opportunities, and learning preferences that would help you customize your advice."

**Your Exercise:** Identify a situation where personalized guidance would be valuable. Create a prompt that instructs Claude to ask you for specific information before providing advice or recommendations, indicating what types of questions would be most helpful.

### 10. Outline Expansion Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern develops ideas from simple outlines into detailed frameworks, progressively adding depth at each level.

**Example:** "Let's develop a comprehensive understanding of climate change solutions:
1. First, create a 5-point outline of the main categories of climate solutions
2. For each category, add 3-4 specific approaches or technologies
3. For the first two categories, expand each approach with key advantages, challenges, and current implementation status
4. For the most promising approach identified, develop a detailed section on implementation strategies"

**Your Exercise:** Choose a complex topic you'd like to explore in depth. Create a prompt that asks Claude to begin with a simple outline and progressively expand it with increasing levels of detail, following your specifications for what aspects deserve deeper exploration.

[![Video: Bear Brown's Prompt Tips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikbearbrown/ENGR-0201-Organizing-Academic-Success-AI-for-Personalized-Learning/refs/heads/main/Claude/Workshop_Two/Artwork/xmbogydnitp.png)](https://youtu.be/NLg2kpBOG7w?si=vL6Jueas05a14g1Z)


### 11. Menu Actions Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern presents a set of clearly defined options that trigger specific responses or actions, similar to a menu interface.

**Example:** "I'd like help with my resume. Please provide a menu of specific assistance options:
1. Review overall structure and formatting
2. Strengthen action verbs and accomplishment statements
3. Tailor content for a specific job description
4. Optimize for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)
5. Create a compelling summary section
I'll respond with my selection number."

**Your Exercise:** Create a prompt that asks Claude to present a menu of options for a topic or task where different paths or focuses would be helpful. Design your menu to help you navigate a complex process or topic efficiently.

### 12. Fact Check List Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern creates a verification framework that clearly distinguishes between confirmed facts, uncertainties, and falsehoods on a specific topic.

**Example:** "Regarding the health effects of intermittent fasting, please create a fact-checking framework with:
- CONFIRMED FACTS: Claims supported by multiple peer-reviewed studies
- EMERGING EVIDENCE: Claims with preliminary research support but needing further validation
- COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS: Popular claims contradicted by scientific evidence
- UNKNOWNS: Areas where research is currently insufficient to draw conclusions"

**Your Exercise:** Select a topic relevant to your interests where distinguishing fact from fiction is important. Create a prompt requesting a fact-checking framework with clearly defined categories for different levels of certainty and evidence.

### 13. Tail Generation Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern adds conversation continuity by appending questions or suggestions at the end of AI outputs to maintain engagement.

**Example:** "Explain the basics of blockchain technology, and conclude your explanation by suggesting 2-3 specific aspects of blockchain I might want to explore next based on what beginners typically find most interesting or relevant."

**Your Exercise:** Create a prompt about a topic you're learning about that specifically requests helpful suggestions or questions at the end to guide your continued exploration. Consider how those suggestions could best match your learning goals.

### 14. Semantic Filter Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern implements criteria to evaluate and modify AI responses based on relevance, appropriateness, or other defined parameters.

**Example:** "I'm researching meditation techniques for a class of elementary school students. Please provide information that:
- Is developmentally appropriate for 8-10 year olds
- Focuses on techniques that can be completed in 5 minutes or less
- Avoids religious terminology or concepts
- Emphasizes concrete benefits related to focus and emotional regulation"

**Your Exercise:** Identify a topic where specific filters or constraints would improve the relevance and usefulness of information. Create a prompt that clearly defines the semantic filters you want applied to Claude's response.

### 15. Helpful Assistant Pattern Exercise

**Definition:** This pattern frames the AI as supportive, helpful, and empathetic, prioritizing usefulness and constructive guidance over criticism.

**Example:** "I'm trying to learn Python programming but finding it difficult to understand functions. As a helpful, encouraging coding mentor who remembers what it's like to be a beginner, please explain functions in a way that builds my confidence while providing clear, practical guidance. Include simple examples and gentle corrections of common misconceptions."

**Your Exercise:** Create a prompt for a situation where you would benefit from supportive, encouraging guidance. Specify the tone, approach, and balance of encouragement vs. constructive feedback that would be most helpful for your learning or growth in this area.

## Combining Patterns: The Master Writer's Approach

The greatest writers don't rely on a single technique but combine approaches as needed. Toni Morrison seamlessly blends multiple narrative techniques in "Beloved," shifting between perspectives, timeframes, and styles to create a rich tapestry.

Similarly, effective prompt engineering often involves combining patterns. You might employ the Persona Pattern to establish voice, the Template Pattern to structure the response, and elements of the Recipe Pattern to ensure step-by-step clarity in certain sections.

**Combined Example:**
"Acting as a developmental editor with the precise insight of F. Scott Fitzgerald's editorial notes (Persona Pattern), analyze this draft essay using the following structure (Template Pattern):
1. First, identify the core argument and thesis
2. Then, examine how well the evidence supports this thesis
3. Next, evaluate the logical flow between paragraphs
4. Finally, suggest improvements using a step-by-step revision plan (Recipe Pattern)"
