# Project Status Summary: February - May 2025

## Summary of Work Completed (Feb - May)

**Project 1: Domain-Specific Vector Embedding Optimization (February - May)**

This project centered on enhancing the performance of vector embedding models for specialized financial domains by fine-tuning them on domain-specific data. Key activities and achievements included:

*   **Data Foundation & Synthesis (February - March):**
    *   Sourced comprehensive textual data covering diverse financial topics such as **blockchain technology, quantitative analysis, and personal finance** from a variety of materials including books, academic papers, and specialized websites.
    *   Leveraged this rich corpus to **synthetically generate a high-quality dataset of Question/Answer pairs** using advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs like Llama 3).
    *   Developed and refined modules for efficient document processing, answer generation, and question generation to build the domain-specific training data. This involved creating systems for managing the lifecycle of dataset creation, from initial document ingestion to the final structured QA pairs.
    *   Established a robust project environment, including containerization, dependency management, and secure configuration for API keys and other sensitive information.

*   **Model Fine-Tuning & Iteration (February - April):**
    *   Utilized baseline embedding models such as **`mxbai-embed-large` and `all-MiniLM-L12-v2`** for initial inference and as a benchmark for comparison.
    *   Implemented and experimented with various **fine-tuning algorithms, including contrastive learning and supervised fine-tuning approaches**, to adapt the models to the nuances of the financial domain. This involved setting up infrastructure for storing and managing fine-tuned model artifacts.
    *   Managed vector data for both original and fine-tuned embeddings using Chroma DB, facilitating efficient retrieval and comparison during experimentation.
    *   Conducted numerous iterative cycles of dataset refinement, model fine-tuning, and performance analysis, including specific efforts to generate enhanced financial datasets.

*   **Benchmarking, Evaluation & Optimization (March - May):**
    *   Developed a comprehensive benchmarking suite to rigorously evaluate model performance post fine-tuning against the original models. This included tools for evaluating answer quality and integrating with frameworks like RAGAS for more nuanced assessment.
    *   Assessed models against key **evaluation metrics including retrieval accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)**.
    *   A significant outcome was achieving up to **60% faster inference times with the fine-tuned models while maintaining comparable retrieval performance** to the original, often larger, models. This optimization was a key focus, addressing bugs and improving processing efficiency in the benchmarking pipeline.
    *   Developed utilities for secure API key management and created tools for visualizing benchmark results and project metrics through dashboards.

*   **Consolidation & Documentation (May):**
    *   Focused on consolidating the various components‚Äîdataset synthesis, fine-tuning processes, and benchmarking tools‚Äîinto a cohesive and robust pipeline.
    *   Updated and finalized project documentation, including a detailed `README.md`, to outline the project's architecture, features, setup instructions, and key findings.
    *   Ensured all system components were fully functional and met the defined acceptance criteria for performance and reliability.
