# OPT Portal – Figma Designs & User Flows

This repository contains the Figma-based UI/UX designs for the **OPT Portal Project**, aimed at streamlining the Optional Practical Training (OPT) application process for international students.

## Figma Design Overview

The Figma designs cover end-to-end user flows, visual components, and interface layouts across multiple user roles. These designs are intended to guide frontend development, ensure design consistency, and align user experience goals with project requirements.
