# Kanban Board Project – Figma Designs & User Flows

This repository contains the Figma-based UI/UX designs for the **Kanban Board Project**, which is designed to enhance the project management experience, specifically for the OPT Portal. The board is tailored to track tasks, monitor project progress, and improve communication between admins, project managers, and volunteers.

## Figma Design Overview

The Figma designs include detailed user flows, visual components, and interface layouts for all core roles within the Kanban Board system. These designs serve as the foundation for frontend development and ensure consistency across the user interface.
