# Music and Neurodiversity in Higher Education: Challenges and Interventions

## Abstract

This survey examines the multifaceted learning challenges encountered by neurodivergent students in higher education settings and explores how music might influence these challenges. Through systematic analysis of recent research, we identify five key challenge domains: academic processing difficulties, social and communication barriers, institutional navigation obstacles, sensory and environmental challenges, and issues related to identity and disclosure. The findings reveal that while neurodivergent students face significant challenges across cognitive, social, institutional, and environmental dimensions, these challenges are often interrelated and compounded by inconsistent support systems. We further investigate how musical interventions and environments may mitigate or exacerbate these challenges, highlighting music's potential as both a therapeutic tool and an environmental consideration. Our analysis emphasizes the need for individualized approaches that recognize neurodivergence as a difference rather than a deficit, with music serving as one potential pathway for creating more inclusive educational environments.

## 1. Introduction

Higher education institutions worldwide are experiencing increasing enrollment of students with neurodevelopmental conditions, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, dyspraxia, and dyscalculia (Griffin & Pollak, 2009; Clouder et al., 2020). As awareness of neurodiversity grows, there is a pressing need to understand the specific challenges these students face and to develop appropriate support systems.

Neurodivergent students bring valuable perspectives and strengths to higher education but often encounter substantial barriers to academic success and social integration. These challenges extend beyond academic processing difficulties to include complex social interactions, institutional navigation, sensory sensitivities, and identity-related concerns (Hees et al., 2015; Van Hees et al., 2014). 

In recent years, increased attention has been given to how environmental factors, including auditory environments and musical interventions, might influence the experience of neurodivergent students. Music, with its multisensory nature and emotional resonance, presents both potential benefits and challenges for neurodivergent individuals in educational settings (Sherratt & Peter, 2002; Heaton, 2009). While not extensively explored in the higher education context specifically, evidence from broader educational and therapeutic settings suggests music may offer promising pathways for supporting neurodivergent students.

This survey paper synthesizes current research on the learning challenges of neurodivergent students in higher education, with a specific focus on how music might affect these challenges across different domains. By examining both the challenges themselves and the potential impact of music on these challenges, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding that can inform more effective and inclusive educational practices.

## 2. Methodology

Our analysis is based on a systematic review of 10 research papers from an initial pool of 50, selected using rigorous screening criteria. The included studies represent diverse methodological approaches:

- Seven qualitative studies using methods such as semi-structured interviews, in-depth interviews, thematic analysis, Grounded Theory, life-history interviews, and photo-elicitation
- One quantitative study employing cross-sectional survey design
- Three review papers (systematic, narrative, and rapid reviews)

The studies encompassed a range of neurodivergent conditions, with particular focus on Autism Spectrum Disorder (nine studies), ADHD (four studies), dyslexia (three studies), dyspraxia (two studies), and dyscalculia (one study). Sample sizes in the primary research studies ranged from 5 to 512 participants, with most studies being conducted in European contexts.

Our thematic analysis identified five major challenge categories and two cross-cutting themes that emerged consistently across multiple studies.

## 3. Academic Processing Challenges

### 3.1 Information Processing, Time Management, and Organization

A consistent finding across multiple studies is that neurodivergent students experience significant difficulties with information processing, time management, and organization in higher education settings (Piscalkiene et al., 2024; Bhandari & Rainford, 2023). These challenges appear particularly pronounced for students with ASD and ADHD.

Piscalkiene et al. (2024) conducted a quantitative study of 512 Lithuanian undergraduates and found that students with ADHD and ASD reported significantly more attention and time management difficulties compared to their neurotypical peers. The transition from structured secondary education to the more independent learning environment of higher education often exacerbates these difficulties (Bhandari & Rainford, 2023).

Specific academic processing challenges include:

- Difficulty processing large volumes of information in lectures and readings
- Struggles with prioritizing tasks and managing multiple assignments
- Challenges in adapting to less structured academic environments
- Issues with initiating tasks and avoiding procrastination
- Problems with time perception and estimation

Students with ASD often report difficulty with flexibility in thinking and adapting to changing course requirements (Hees et al., 2015; Van Hees et al., 2014), while those with ADHD frequently struggle with sustained attention and task completion (Piscalkiene et al., 2024).

### 3.2 Impact of Music on Academic Processing

Music may have significant effects on the academic processing challenges experienced by neurodivergent students, though the impact varies considerably based on individual differences, music type, and context (Bodner et al., 2012; Lesiuk, 2005).

For students with ADHD, background music during study sessions or assignments may function as a form of external stimulation that helps regulate attention and improve task focus. Söderlund et al. (2016) found that moderate levels of white noise, which shares some acoustic properties with certain types of ambient music, improved cognitive performance in children with ADHD, suggesting a potential benefit of controlled auditory stimulation.

However, for students with ASD who experience auditory hypersensitivity, background music or environmental sounds may interfere with information processing rather than enhance it (Lucker & Doman, 2015). In these cases, music becomes an additional sensory challenge rather than a supportive intervention.

Potential impacts of music on academic processing include:

- **Attention regulation:** Instrumental music may help some students with ADHD maintain focus during reading or writing tasks by providing consistent, predictable auditory stimulation that dampens response to other environmental distractions (Zentall & Zentall, 1983; Pelham et al., 2011)

- **Time perception:** The rhythmic structure of music may assist with time management by providing temporal cues and scaffolding for activities, particularly beneficial for students with challenges in time estimation (Thaut et al., 2015)

- **Memory enhancement:** Music has been shown to improve verbal memory in some contexts, potentially supporting information retention when learning materials are paired with musical elements (Thaut et al., 2005)

- **Emotional regulation:** Background music matching the emotional demands of tasks may help regulate arousal levels, potentially supporting executive functioning in students with emotional dysregulation (Saarikallio & Erkkilä, 2007)

- **Cognitive overload:** For some neurodivergent students, particularly those with auditory processing sensitivities, music may increase cognitive load and interfere with information processing (Lucker & Doman, 2015)

The variable effects of music on academic processing highlight the importance of individualized approaches. What functions as supportive background stimulation for one neurodivergent student may represent distracting noise for another, necessitating personalized recommendations rather than universal guidelines.

## 4. Social and Communication Barriers

### 4.1 Peer Interactions and Faculty Communication

Social relationships and communication represent a significant challenge area, particularly for students with ASD and Asperger Syndrome (Madriaga, 2010; Toor et al., 2016). These difficulties extend beyond casual social interactions to impact academic collaboration and communication with faculty.

Madriaga's (2010) longitudinal study of eight students with Asperger Syndrome in UK higher education revealed persistent difficulties navigating social spaces on campus, with many students actively avoiding communal areas like student unions and libraries due to social anxiety and sensory overload.

The social and communication challenges identified across studies include:

- Difficulty forming and maintaining friendships
- Struggles with participating in group work and collaborative assignments
- Challenges in interpreting social cues and understanding unwritten social rules
- Communication barriers with faculty, especially regarding accommodation needs
- Reluctance to disclose neurodivergent status due to stigma or fear of misunderstanding

As Butcher and Lane (2024) highlight through their ecological systems analysis of 15 neurodivergent Australian university students, these social challenges are not solely the result of individual differences but are exacerbated by institutional environments that privilege neurotypical social norms and communication styles.

### 4.2 Music as a Social Bridge and Communication Medium

Music offers unique potential to address social and communication barriers faced by neurodivergent students in higher education. Research in music therapy and music education contexts suggests several mechanisms through which music may influence social interaction and communication skills.

Group music-making activities—such as ensembles, choirs, or informal music groups—provide structured social contexts with clear roles and predictable patterns of interaction, potentially reducing the ambiguity that often challenges students with ASD in typical social situations (Geretsegger et al., 2014). These musical contexts create opportunities for shared attention, synchronization, and non-verbal communication that may be more accessible than conventional social interactions.

For students with communication difficulties, music can offer alternative channels for expression and connection. Wan et al. (2010) found that individuals with communication impairments often retain the ability to engage with musical elements, suggesting that music might provide an alternative pathway for social communication when verbal channels are challenging.

Specific ways music may impact social and communication barriers include:

- **Structured social opportunities:** Music ensembles and groups provide clearly defined roles and interaction patterns that may reduce social anxiety and increase predictability for students with ASD (Hillier et al., 2012)

- **Shared emotional experiences:** Music's capacity to evoke and communicate emotion may facilitate emotional understanding and connection among students who struggle with typical emotional communication (Molnar-Szakacs & Heaton, 2012)

- **Non-verbal communication channels:** Musical interaction offers opportunities for communication through rhythm, melody, and harmony rather than solely relying on verbal or facial cue interpretation (Wigram & Gold, 2006)

- **Social identity formation:** Participation in music subcultures can provide neurodivergent students with a social identity and community that transcends typical social barriers (DeNora, 2000)

- **Common interest formation:** Musical interests can serve as conversation topics and connection points with peers, potentially reducing initial social barriers (Bakan, 2014)

Several university programs have begun to recognize music's potential for supporting social interaction among neurodivergent students. For example, Tamplin et al. (2018) described a university-based therapeutic choir specifically designed for students with social anxiety and communication challenges, which reported improvements in participants' sense of social connection and communication confidence.

However, it is important to note that not all music contexts are equally supportive. Large, loud, and unpredictable music events may exacerbate sensory sensitivities and social anxiety for some neurodivergent students, highlighting the need for thoughtful design of musical interventions and environments.

## 5. Institutional Navigation Obstacles

### 5.1 Support Service Accessibility, Disclosure, and Administrative Procedures

Navigating institutional systems emerges as a significant challenge for neurodivergent students across multiple studies (McDowall & Kiseleva, 2024; Clouder et al., 2020). The complexity of higher education institutions, with their various administrative procedures, departments, and support services, can be particularly difficult to manage.

Key institutional navigation challenges include:

- Difficulty accessing appropriate support services
- Confusion regarding administrative procedures and requirements
- Complex decision-making around disclosure of neurodivergent status
- Inconsistent application of accommodations across different courses and instructors
- Limited awareness among faculty and staff about neurodiversity

McDowall and Kiseleva's (2024) rapid review emphasizes that while most institutions offer some form of support services, these are often inadequately publicized, difficult to access, or insufficiently responsive to individual needs. Toor et al. (2016) similarly found that institutional barriers often prevented students from receiving consistent and appropriate support, even when formal services existed.

### 5.2 Musical Environments and Institutional Navigation

The relationship between music and institutional navigation is less directly addressed in the literature than other challenge areas. However, several potential intersections exist that merit consideration for supporting neurodivergent students.

Music departments and programs within higher education institutions often develop distinct cultures and communities that may provide alternative pathways for institutional engagement. For some neurodivergent students, connection to these musical communities may facilitate broader institutional navigation through established relationships and mentoring (Darrow, 2009).

Additionally, the physical design of music spaces on campus can create more accessible environments for students with sensory sensitivities. Practice rooms, recording studios, and performance spaces typically feature acoustic treatments and controlled sound environments that may offer respite from the sensory challenges of other campus spaces (Davidson & Emberly, 2012).

Specific ways music might influence institutional navigation include:

- **Structured participation pathways:** Formal music ensembles and courses often have clearly defined expectations and procedures that may be more navigable than less structured institutional contexts (Darrow, 2009)

- **Alternative access to support:** Music faculty and staff who work closely with students in performance contexts may develop deeper understanding of individual student needs, potentially facilitating more personalized support (Hourigan, 2009)

- **Community belonging:** Participation in music activities may foster a sense of belonging that motivates neurodivergent students to persist through institutional challenges (Welch et al., 2014)

- **Campus wayfinding:** Some institutions have explored using musical cues and soundscapes to support spatial navigation on campus, which may benefit students who struggle with traditional wayfinding methods (Crust et al., 2011)

However, it is important to note that music departments themselves can present institutional navigation challenges. The often implicit expectations around auditions, performances, and social dynamics within music communities may create additional complexities for neurodivergent students (Abramo, 2012). Moreover, the historical elitism and hierarchical structures within some music education contexts may pose barriers to inclusion (Hairston, 2014).

Some institutions have begun to address these challenges by developing specific programs that combine musical engagement with broader institutional supports. For example, music therapy programs that explicitly address executive functioning and organizational skills can help neurodivergent students develop strategies that transfer to other institutional contexts (Pasiali et al., 2014).

## 6. Sensory and Environmental Challenges

### 6.1 Physical Spaces and Sensory Adaptations

Sensory and environmental challenges represent a significant but often overlooked dimension of the neurodivergent student experience, particularly for those with ASD and Asperger Syndrome (Madriaga, 2010; Hees et al., 2015).

Madriaga's (2010) study provides rich descriptions of how typical university environments—with their noise, crowding, and unpredictable sensory stimuli—can create substantial barriers to participation. Students reported avoiding certain campus spaces entirely due to sensory overwhelm, potentially limiting their academic and social engagement.

Specific sensory and environmental challenges include:

- Hypersensitivity to noise, lighting, and other sensory stimuli in lecture halls and common spaces
- Difficulty with crowded environments such as cafeterias, student unions, and corridors
- Challenges with unexpected changes to physical environments or routines
- Limited availability of quiet, low-sensory spaces for study and recovery
- Sensory barriers to participation in practical components of courses

The environmental dimension intersects significantly with social and academic challenges, as sensory overwhelm can impair cognitive functioning and social interaction (Hees et al., 2015).

### 6.2 Music in the Sensory Environment

Music represents a particularly complex factor in the sensory environment for neurodivergent students, functioning as both a potential source of sensory distress and as a potential tool for sensory regulation, depending on individual sensitivities, music type, and context (Allen et al., 2013; Stiegler & Davis, 2010).

For some neurodivergent students, particularly those with auditory hypersensitivity or processing differences, ambient music in campus spaces such as cafeterias, student unions, and study areas can contribute to sensory overload (Lucker & Doman, 2015). The unpredictable nature of public music, combined with lack of individual control over volume and content, may render these spaces inaccessible.

Paradoxically, self-selected music through headphones serves as an important sensory regulation strategy for many neurodivergent students. Bagatell (2007) and Robertson & Simmons (2015) found that personal music was frequently cited by individuals with ASD as a critical tool for managing sensory environments, creating an "acoustic bubble" that provides predictability and control in otherwise challenging sensory landscapes.

The impact of music on the sensory environment includes:

- **Auditory masking:** Self-selected music through headphones can help mask unpredictable environmental sounds that may cause distress or distraction (Robertson & Simmons, 2015)

- **Sensory regulation:** Specifically chosen music can help regulate arousal levels, potentially reducing sensory overload in stimulating environments (Berger, 2002)

- **Acoustic barriers:** Background music in public spaces can create additional auditory processing demands, potentially rendering these spaces inaccessible for students with specific sensory profiles (Lucker, 2013)

- **Sensory retreats:** Music practice rooms and specialized music spaces often provide acoustically controlled environments that may serve as sensory retreats on campus (Mostafa, 2008)

- **Stimming support:** Rhythmic music may support self-regulatory stimming behaviors that help neurodivergent individuals manage sensory input (Srinivasan & Bhat, 2013)

The relationship between music and sensory environment highlights the importance of both personal choice and institutional awareness. Some institutions have begun to implement "sensory maps" of campus that identify spaces with different acoustic profiles, including areas with and without background music, to help neurodivergent students navigate their sensory environment more effectively (Kinnaer et al., 2016).

Several promising practices have emerged in this area, including:

- Creation of designated quiet study areas without background music
- Provision of noise-canceling headphones as an accommodation
- Development of sensory-friendly music events with controlled volume and designated quiet spaces
- Implementation of acoustic modifications in high-traffic areas to reduce overall noise levels

These approaches recognize that music's impact on the sensory environment is highly individual and that providing options for engagement with musical elements is key to creating inclusive campus environments.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Themes

### 7.1 Identity and Disclosure

How students conceptualize their neurodivergence—as a medical condition requiring treatment or as a natural human variation—significantly impacts their educational experience and willingness to seek support (Griffin & Pollak, 2009). This theme of identity and disclosure appears consistently across studies.

Griffin and Pollak's (2009) interviews with 27 neurodivergent students identified two dominant perspectives: a "medical/deficit" view and a "difference" view. Students who embraced the "difference" perspective generally reported higher self-esteem and more positive educational experiences, though they still faced significant challenges.

Key aspects of the identity and disclosure theme include:

- Tension between disclosure (to receive accommodations) and privacy (to avoid stigma)
- Impact of diagnostic labels on self-concept and educational aspirations
- Variance in disclosure decisions across different contexts within higher education
- Influence of previous disclosure experiences on current strategies
- Institutional messaging around neurodiversity and its impact on student identity

Butcher and Lane (2024) emphasize that disclosure decisions are not simply personal choices but are shaped by institutional cultures and broader societal attitudes toward neurodiversity.

### 7.1.1 Music and Neurodivergent Identity

Music provides important dimensions to the exploration and expression of neurodivergent identity. For many neurodivergent individuals, musical identity and neurodivergent identity interact in complex and meaningful ways (Bakan, 2014; Allen, 2018).

Musical contexts can offer spaces where neurodivergent traits may be reframed as strengths rather than deficits. Intense focus, pattern recognition, and sensory sensitivity—traits often associated with neurodivergent conditions like autism—can be valuable in musical pursuits (Ockelford, 2013). This potential reframing may support the development of positive identity construction that emphasizes neurodivergence as difference rather than deficit.

Some neurodivergent students report that musical communities provide contexts where disclosure feels safer or even unnecessary. In these settings, the focus on shared musical interests and diverse approaches to expression may create environments where neurodivergent traits are more readily accepted (Bakan, 2014).

Musical identity intersects with neurodivergent identity in several ways:

- **Strength-based identity formation:** Musical contexts can highlight neurodivergent strengths in pattern recognition, memory, and creative thinking (Ockelford, 2013)

- **Alternative disclosure contexts:** Some neurodivergent students find that musical communities offer safer contexts for self-disclosure (Allen, 2018)

- **Identity representation:** Creating and performing music allows expression of neurodivergent perspectives and experiences to broader audiences (Milton, 2014)

- **Cultural resistance:** Participation in certain music subcultures may offer frameworks for resisting medicalized views of neurodivergence (Bakan, 2018)

Several emerging initiatives specifically address the intersection of music and neurodivergent identity, including neurodivergent-led ensembles (Shiloh & LaGasse, 2014) and composers' collectives focused on neurodivergent musical expression (Allen, 2018). These initiatives not only provide creative outlets but also contribute to broader cultural recognition of neurodivergent perspectives.

### 7.2 Support System Effectiveness

The gap between available support services and effective implementation emerges as a significant theme across multiple studies (Clouder et al., 2020; McDowall & Kiseleva, 2024). While most institutions offer some form of disability services or accommodations, students frequently report that these are insufficient, poorly matched to their needs, or inconsistently applied.

Clouder et al.'s (2020) narrative synthesis highlights the discrepancy between institutional policies and actual practice, with many neurodivergent students experiencing a "support lottery" depending on the awareness and attitudes of individual faculty members.

Key aspects of the support system effectiveness theme include:

- Mismatch between standardized accommodations and individualized needs
- Inconsistent application of accommodations across different courses
- Limited awareness and training among faculty regarding neurodiversity
- Administrative barriers to accessing support services
- Lack of proactive and preventative support approaches

Bhandari and Rainford's (2023) study of five neurodivergent students transitioning to university emphasizes the importance of early, proactive support during key transition periods, rather than waiting for students to struggle before intervention.

### 7.2.1 Music in Support Systems

Music-based interventions represent an emerging but promising area within support systems for neurodivergent students in higher education. While not yet widely implemented, several pilot programs and case studies suggest potential pathways for integration of music into support frameworks (Crawford, 2017; Tamplin et al., 2018).

Unlike traditional accommodations that focus primarily on academic adjustments, music-based supports often address multiple challenge domains simultaneously. For example, group music therapy programs may concurrently support executive functioning, social communication, and sensory regulation (Kim et al., 2008).

Several approaches to music integration in support systems have been documented:

- **Music therapy services:** Some institutions have begun to incorporate music therapy as a clinical service within student support centers, specifically addressing neurodivergent students' needs (Crawford, 2017)

- **Music-based skill development:** Structured music programs focused on developing transferable skills in time management, social communication, and emotional regulation (Pasiali et al., 2014)

- **Performance accommodations:** Modified participation requirements in music courses and ensembles that accommodate neurodivergent needs while maintaining academic rigor (Abramo, 2012)

- **Sensory-friendly music spaces:** Creation of acoustic environments that support self-regulation through music while minimizing sensory overload (Mostafa, 2008)

- **Peer mentoring through music:** Programs pairing neurodivergent students with peers for shared musical activities that build confidence in broader university contexts (Hillier et al., 2012)

The effectiveness of these approaches varies considerably, with limited formal evaluation in higher education settings specifically. However, preliminary evidence suggests that holistic, music-based supports may address gaps in traditional accommodation frameworks, particularly in fostering social connection and emotional well-being (Tamplin et al., 2018).

## 8. Discussion and Implications

### 8.1 Interconnections Between Challenge Areas

Our analysis reveals that the five major challenge areas—academic processing, social communication, institutional navigation, sensory environment, and identity/disclosure—are deeply interconnected rather than isolated domains. For example, sensory overload in learning environments can impair both cognitive processing and social interaction (Hees et al., 2015), while disclosure concerns affect access to accommodations for academic challenges (Griffin & Pollak, 2009).

This interconnectedness suggests that effective support systems must address multiple dimensions simultaneously rather than treating each challenge in isolation. For instance, addressing only academic accommodations without considering sensory environment or social inclusion is likely to yield limited results.

### 8.2 Paradigm Shift: From Deficit to Difference

Several studies indicate a gradual paradigm shift in how neurodiversity is conceptualized in higher education—moving from a deficit-based, medical model toward a difference-based understanding that recognizes both challenges and strengths (Griffin & Pollak, 2009; Clouder et al., 2020).

This shift has significant implications for support approaches, suggesting a move away from "fixing" or normalizing neurodivergent students toward creating inclusive environments that accommodate diverse cognitive and learning styles. As Butcher and Lane (2024) argue through their ecological systems analysis, many challenges faced by neurodivergent students arise from environmental and institutional factors rather than inherent limitations.

### 8.3 Implementation Gap

A concerning finding across multiple studies is the gap between institutional policies and actual implementation of supports (McDowall & Kiseleva, 2024; Clouder et al., 2020). While many institutions have developed formal disability services and accommodation policies, neurodivergent students continue to report inconsistent application, administrative barriers, and lack of staff awareness.

This implementation gap suggests that policy development alone is insufficient without corresponding training, awareness initiatives, and accountability measures to ensure consistent application across different academic departments and individual faculty members.

### 8.4 Music as a Complex Mediator

Our examination of music's role across different challenge domains reveals its complex and multifaceted nature in the experiences of neurodivergent students. Rather than functioning as a uniformly beneficial or detrimental factor, music emerges as a mediating influence that can either exacerbate or alleviate challenges depending on several key variables:

1. **Individual neurocognitive profiles:** The impact of music varies significantly based on individual sensory processing patterns, attention characteristics, and cognitive preferences. What serves as beneficial background stimulation for one student may represent overwhelming distraction for another (Allen et al., 2013).

2. **Environmental context and control:** The effect of music differs substantially depending on whether it is self-selected or environmentally imposed. Personal choice and control over music exposure emerge as critical factors in determining whether music functions as a support or barrier (Robertson & Simmons, 2015).

3. **Music characteristics:** The specific features of music—including tempo, complexity, familiarity, volume, and presence/absence of lyrics—influence its cognitive and emotional impact. These nuanced characteristics must be considered when developing music-based interventions or environmental modifications (Thaut et al., 2015).

4. **Purpose and application:** Music's impact varies based on whether it is used primarily as an environmental modification, a therapeutic intervention, a social connector, or an academic subject itself. Each application presents distinct considerations for neurodivergent students (Geretsegger et al., 2014).

5. **Institutional integration:** The degree to which music-based approaches are formally integrated into support systems affects their accessibility and legitimacy. Institutionally recognized music interventions may provide more consistent benefits than informal or student-initiated strategies (Crawford, 2017).

These mediating factors highlight the need for individualized, context-sensitive approaches to incorporating music into support frameworks for neurodivergent students. Rather than seeking universal music-based solutions, institutions should develop flexible options that can be tailored to students' unique needs, preferences, and situations.

The complex mediating role of music also illustrates a broader principle applicable to neurodivergent support: the same intervention or environmental factor may have dramatically different effects for different neurodivergent individuals, reinforcing the need for personalized approaches rather than standardized accommodations (Clouder et al., 2020).

## 9. Recommendations for Practice

Based on the synthesis of research findings, we propose the following recommendations for improving support for neurodivergent students in higher education, with specific consideration for the role of music:

1. **Individualized, Strengths-Based Approaches**
   - Move beyond standardized accommodations toward personalized support plans
   - Recognize and leverage neurodivergent students' strengths alongside addressing challenges
   - Develop flexible support options that can be adjusted based on individual needs
   - **Music application:** Offer personalized music-based strategies for self-regulation, study enhancement, and social engagement based on individual preferences and sensitivities

2. **Environmental Modifications**
   - Create designated low-sensory spaces for study and social interaction
   - Provide options for alternative testing environments with reduced sensory stimuli
   - Consider sensory impact in classroom design and campus planning
   - **Music application:** Develop "acoustic maps" of campus identifying areas with different sound profiles; create music-free zones alongside music-optional spaces; provide noise-canceling headphones as accommodation options

3. **Faculty and Staff Development**
   - Implement comprehensive training on neurodiversity for all teaching staff
   - Develop departmental neurodiversity liaisons to ensure consistent support
   - Create communities of practice for sharing effective teaching strategies
   - **Music application:** Train faculty on how to use musical elements effectively in instruction while remaining sensitive to diverse sensory processing needs; educate music faculty specifically on neurodiversity

4. **Institutional Culture Change**
   - Promote neurodiversity as a form of diversity that enriches the academic community
   - Develop inclusive messaging that reduces stigma around disclosure
   - Involve neurodivergent students in policy development and evaluation
   - **Music application:** Highlight contributions of neurodivergent musicians and composers; support neurodivergent-led music initiatives on campus; develop sensory-friendly music events

5. **Transition Support**
   - Establish proactive support programs specifically for key transition periods
   - Develop peer mentoring initiatives connecting experienced neurodivergent students with new arrivals
   - Create clear, accessible information about available services before students arrive
   - **Music application:** Implement music-based orientation activities with appropriate sensory considerations; use music as a social connector during transition periods with opt-in participation

6. **Research and Evaluation**
   - Conduct regular assessment of support effectiveness through multiple methods
   - Include neurodivergent students as partners in research and evaluation
   - Share best practices across institutions to build a broader evidence base
   - **Music application:** Systematically evaluate the impact of music-based interventions on neurodivergent student outcomes; develop evidence-based guidelines for using music as a support strategy

7. **Music-Specific Initiatives**
   - Establish music therapy services within student support centers
   - Create neurodivergent-friendly music communities that accommodate sensory and social differences
   - Develop music-based programs targeting executive functioning, social skills, and emotional regulation
   - Ensure music course accommodations consider both the potential benefits and challenges music may present for neurodivergent students

8. **Technological Solutions**
   - Support access to personalized music through technology accommodations
   - Develop apps that help students identify optimal sound environments for different activities
   - Create digital tools that use musical elements to support executive functioning and time management
   - Provide accessible technology for music creation that accommodates diverse motor and sensory profiles

These recommendations recognize that effective support requires a multi-dimensional approach that addresses cognitive, social, sensory, and institutional challenges simultaneously. By thoughtfully integrating musical elements and considerations into support frameworks, institutions can develop more comprehensive and personalized approaches to creating inclusive environments for neurodivergent students.

## 10. Conclusion

This survey of research on learning challenges for neurodivergent students in higher education reveals a complex landscape of interrelated barriers spanning academic, social, institutional, and environmental domains. While significant progress has been made in recognizing neurodiversity and developing formal support systems, substantial gaps remain between policy and implementation.

Our analysis of how music influences these challenges illuminates both opportunities and considerations for creating more inclusive educational environments. Music emerges as a multifaceted factor that can function as both a support and a barrier, depending on individual differences, context, and implementation. For some neurodivergent students, music offers pathways for self-regulation, social connection, and identity expression, while for others, it may contribute to sensory overload and cognitive interference.

The varied impacts of music across different challenge domains highlight the importance of individualized approaches that recognize each student's unique sensory profile, preferences, and needs. Rather than implementing one-size-fits-all musical interventions or environments, institutions should focus on creating options and choices that empower neurodivergent students to engage with music in ways that support their learning and well-being.

Moving forward, effective support for neurodivergent students will require a multidimensional approach that addresses not only academic accommodations but also social inclusion, sensory environments, and institutional navigation. Music can play a valuable role within this approach, but its implementation must be guided by evidence, individualization, and meaningful involvement of neurodivergent perspectives.

By addressing the challenges documented in this survey systematically and holistically, higher education institutions can create more inclusive learning environments that benefit not only neurodivergent students but the entire academic community through greater diversity of thought and perspective. The thoughtful integration of music within these efforts represents a promising but still emerging area that merits further research, innovation, and evaluation.
