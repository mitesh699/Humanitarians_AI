# Bi-Weekly Report 4
**Name**: Samhita Kolluri   
**Date Range**: March 17 - March 31, 2025

## Summary of Work Completed
- Developed scoring logic in `contrastive_score.py` using cosine similarity (stance) and dot product (topic).
- Created configurable scoring weights `[0.3, 0.7]` for flexible tuning.
- Built vector retrieval using ChromaDB filtering for top-5 then top-3 ranking.
Conducted end-to-end test runs using inputs such as "Renewable energy is the future", confirming contrastive outputs and verifying score spread between neutral and opposing documents.

## Challenges Encountered
**Challenge 1:**    
Retrieval sometimes returned documents with low topical relevance due to noisy vector neighbors.

**Solution 1:**     
Introduced a topic similarity threshold filter (e.g. â‰¥ 0.6) to discard low-quality candidates before contrastive scoring. This significantly improved ranking precision

## Goals for the Next Two Weeks
- Build the initial benchmarking layer to evaluate retrieval and ranking quality.
- Implement a centralized configuration management system in `config.py` to control: Model paths, Scoring thresholds, Retrieval cutoffs, Embedding dimensions.
- Begin logging structured output results for evaluation across a controlled test set.
