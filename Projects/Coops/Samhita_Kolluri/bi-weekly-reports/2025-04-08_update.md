# Bi-Weekly Report 5
**Name**: Samhita Kolluri   
**Date Range**: April 1 - April 15, 2025

## Summary of Work Completed
- Created configuration module (`config.py`) to manage hyperparameters system-wide.
- Set up logging across modules to track retrieval flow, embedding generation, scoring breakdowns.
- Manual benchmarking of scoring accuracy with score ranges (-0.31 to -0.33).
- Planned integration of RLHF or manual adjustment for scoring feedback.

## Challenges Encountered

**Challenge 1:**  
Scoring outputs across different document pairs showed relatively **narrow ranges** (all around -0.3), reducing contrast spread and making ranking difficult.

**Solution 1:**  
Inspected the scoring function in `contrastive_score.py`, and adjusted threshold filters to remove near-neutral results. Planned the next step to normalize scoring ranges to support better downstream evaluation and visualization.

## Goals for the Next Two Weeks
- Fine-tune a stance-aware LLM using a curated SNLI-style contradiction dataset.
  - Prepare and tokenize training data in Hugging Face-compatible format.
  - Train using triplet loss or contrastive loss to maximize stance divergence.
- Upload the fine-tuned model to Hugging Face and integrate it into the contrastive scoring pipeline for improved semantic opposition detection.
- Re-benchmark the retrieval performance after model integration using metrics.
